gxas21,spez,"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",1591383887.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_gxas21,42293,False,39710,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Thanks,

As a reminder, Reddit’s advertising policy already forbids deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising (political advertisers included). Further, each political ad is manually reviewed for messaging and creative content, we do not accept political ads from advertisers and candidates based outside the United States, and we only allow political ads at the federal level.

That said, beginning today, we will *also* require political advertisers to work directly with our sales team and leave comments “on” for (at least) the first 24 hours of any given campaign. We will strongly encourage political advertisers to use this opportunity to engage directly with users in the comments.

In tandem, we are launching a subreddit dedicated to political ads transparency, which will list all political ad campaigns running on Reddit dating back to January 1, 2019. In this community, you will find information on the individual advertiser, their targeting, impressions, and spend on a per-campaign basis. We plan to consistently update this subreddit as new political ads run on Reddit, so we can provide transparency into our political advertisers and the conversation their ad(s) inspires. If you would like to follow along, please subscribe to [r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/) for more information.

We hope this update will give you a chance to engage directly and transparently with political advertisers around important political issues, and provide a line of sight into the campaigns and political organizations seeking your attention. By requiring political advertisers to work closely with the Reddit Sales team, ensuring comments remain enabled for 24 hours, and establishing a political ads transparency subreddit, we believe we can better serve the Reddit ecosystem by spurring important conversation, enabling our users to provide their own feedback on political ads, and better protecting the community from inappropriate political ads, bad actors, and misinformation.

Please see the full updated political ads policy below:

*All political advertisements must be manually approved by Reddit. In order to be approved, the advertiser must be actively working with a Reddit Sales Representative (for more information on the managed sales process, please see “Advertising at Scale”* [*here*](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising)*.) Political advertisers will also be asked to present additional information to verify their identity and/or authorization to place such advertisements.*

*Political advertisements on Reddit include, but are not limited to, the following:*

* *Ads related to campaigns or elections, or that solicit political donations;*
* *Ads that promote voting or voter registration (discouraging voting or voter registration is not allowed);*
* *Ads promoting political merchandise (for example, products featuring a public office holder or candidate, political slogans, etc);*
* *Issue ads or advocacy ads pertaining to topics of potential legislative or political importance or placed by political organizations*

*Advertisements in this category must include clear ""paid for by"" disclosures within the ad copy and/or creative, and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the Federal Elections Commission. All political advertisements must also have comments enabled for at least the first 24 hours of the ad run. The advertiser is strongly encouraged to engage with Reddit users directly in these comments. The advertisement and any comments must still adhere to Reddit’s* [*Content Policy*](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)*.*

*Please note additionally that information regarding political ad campaigns and their purchasing individuals or entities may be publicly disclosed by Reddit for transparency purposes.*

*Finally, Reddit only accepts political advertisements within the United States, at the federal level. Political advertisements at the state and local level, or outside of the United States are not allowed.*

The world is experiencing a moment of incredible uncertainty and stress; and throughout this time, it’s become even more clear how valuable Reddit is to millions of people looking for community, a place to seek and share information, provide support to one another, or simply to escape the reality of our collective ‘new normal.’

Over the past 5 years at Reddit, April Fools’ Day has emerged as a time for us to create and discover new things with our community (that’s all of you). It's also a chance for us to celebrate you.

We’ve been testing Polls with a dozen communities over the past couple months, and have gotten a lot of great feedback. We are excited to now release this post type to everyone!

**Why Polls?**

It can sometimes be tough for new redditors and lurkers to know where to start on Reddit, , and to feel a sense of community.

I’ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**

Hi all,

It’s that time of year again when we share Reddit’s annual transparency report.

We share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it’s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.

You’ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we’ve expanded the report to include new data—specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.

## By the numbers

Since the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I’ll call out a few stats below:

**ADMIN REMOVALS**

* In 2019, we removed **\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.
* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed
   * **222k** **pieces of content**,
   * **55.9k accounts**, and
   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).
* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.

**LEGAL REMOVALS**

* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.
* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.

**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**

* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.
   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).
   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.
   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).
* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)

## While I have your attention...

I’d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.

When we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to “force subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.” While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn’t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.

Today, we’re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.

## If you’ve read this far

In addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we’re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.

Hey everyone, 

We wanted to let you know about some changes that we are making today to our [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) regarding content that [threatens, harasses, or bullies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully), which you can read in full [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-threaten-harass-or-bully). 

**Why are we doing this?**
These changes, which were many months in the making, were primarily driven by feedback we received from you all, our users, indicating to us that there was a problem with the narrowness of our previous policy. Specifically, the old policy required a behavior to be “continued” and/or “systematic” for us to be able to take action against it as harassment. It also set a high bar of users fearing for their real-world safety to qualify, which we think is an incorrect calibration. Finally, it wasn’t clear that abuse toward both individuals and groups qualified under the rule. All these things meant that too often, instances of harassment and bullying, even egregious ones, were left unactioned. This was a bad user experience for you all, and frankly, it is something that made us feel not-great too. It was clearly a case of the letter of a rule not matching its spirit.

The changes we’re making today are trying to better address that, as well as to give some meta-context about the spirit of this rule: chiefly, Reddit is a place for conversation. Thus, behavior whose core effect is to shut people out of that conversation through intimidation or abuse has no place on our platform. 

We also hope that this change will take some of the burden off moderators, as it will expand our ability to take action at scale against content that the vast majority of subreddits already have their own rules against-- rules that we support and encourage.

**How will these changes work in practice?**
We all know that context is critically important here, and can be tricky, particularly when we’re talking about typed words on the internet. This is why we’re hoping today’s changes will help us better leverage human user reports. Where previously, we required the harassment victim to make the report to us directly, we’ll now be investigating reports from bystanders as well. We hope this will alleviate some of the burden on the harassee. 

You should also know that we’ll also be harnessing some improved machine-learning tools to help us better sort and prioritize human user reports. But don’t worry, machines will only help us organize and prioritize user reports. They won’t be banning content or users on their own. A human user still has to report the content in order to surface it to us. Likewise, all actual decisions will still be made by a human admin. 

As with any rule change, this will take some time to fully enforce. Our [response times have improved significantly since the start of the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/becbnx/hey_rchangelog_were_rolling_out_some_new/), but we’re always striving to move faster. In the meantime, we encourage moderators to take this opportunity to examine their community rules and make sure that they are not creating an environment where bullying or harassment are tolerated or encouraged.

**What should I do if I see content that I think breaks this rule?**
As always, if you see or experience behavior that you believe is in violation of this rule, please use the report button [“This is abusive or harassing > “It’s targeted harassment”] to let us know. If you believe an entire user account or subreddit is dedicated to harassing or bullying behavior against an individual or group, we want to know that too; [report it to us here](https://www.reddit.com/report).

Thanks. As usual, we’ll hang around for a bit and answer questions.

Hi all,

You may have noticed some new icons popping up alongside Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards on your front page recently—these are **Community Awards**! We started testing these in a [small alpha group back in April](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/bf2jep/hi_rchangelog_were_back_for_another_exciting/) and expanded the group to include more volunteer communities over the past couple of weeks.

As of today, Community Awards are now widely available for mods to create in their communities.

# What Are Community Awards?

Community Awards give mods the ability to create custom Awards for redditors to use in their own communities. Mods can select the images, names, and Coin price of Awards to reflect their own communities. Awards can be priced between 500 Coins and 40,000 Coins.

Community Awards will be available to give in the communities that created them, in addition to Silver, Gold, and Platinum Awards (which are available site-wide).

In the above screenshot from [r/DunderMifflin](https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/), you can see a few new icons in between Gold and Silver. These are **Community Awards**.

# What Are the Benefits of Community Awards?

Community Awards are a new way of showing appreciation to posters and commenters. But unlike Silver, Gold and Platinum, when Community Awards are used, they give Coins back to that community through the **Community Bank**.

With this new update, 20% of Coins spent on Community Awards will go into a bank of Community Coins. For example, in the [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) community if you give the “Star of Excellence” Award (2,000 Coins) to another user, [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/) automatically gets 400 Coins in its Community Bank.

Mods can access the Community Bank to give…

# Mod-Exclusive Awards

Moderators will now have the ability to give Mod-Exclusive Awards, to recognize users for high-quality content that is representative of their community.

Mod-Exclusive Awards will draw from the bank of Community Coins, so Moderators don’t need to spend money to reward users (e.g., for community contests). Mod-Exclusive Awards also have the additional benefit of 1 or more months of Reddit Premium, depending on the Award price.

* Mod-Award costing **1,800 Coins** = **1 month** of Reddit Premium
* Mod-Award costing **5,400 Coins** = **3 months** of Reddit Premium
* … and so on!

Here’s what Mod-Exclusive Awards look like on posts / comments:

# Which Communities Are Eligible for Community Awards?

Community Awards are available to public, SFW, non-banned, non-quarantined communities.

Check out [our companion post on r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/chdxkh/community_awards_creating_new_awards_for_users/) for all the details on how mods can create Awards!

We are looking forward to seeing all your creativity with these new Awards, but **please do note these important considerations** when creating Awards:

* They must comply with [Reddit’s Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy);
* They must not violate intellectual property rights of others; and
* They must be SFW.

# A Coin Giveaway: Mods, Create Some New Awards!

We've seen some pretty great Awards pop up in a few subs already, but now that they're available to more mod teams, we’re seeing which community can create the best collection of six Community Awards!

Participating is pretty simple: **If you are a mod, create an amazing set of six Community Awards that exemplifies the culture of your community, and reply to the stickied comment below with the name of your community.** For 20 random entries, we will put 40,000 Coins into to each community's Community Bank, to give back to users in your communities!",False,0.71,

Edit (2020/03/30): We released a feature where you will get a push notification when you get a new follower. If you have your push notifications enabled on our mobile apps, or desktop notifications enabled, you should receive one. We are working on expanding this feature to all users, even without push notifications. The follower list is still delayed until later this year.

Hi everyone,

We collect a lot of feedback from you all, and one theme we’ve heard consistently from users is that many of you want more visibility when users follow you. As we move the new profiles out of beta, we wanted to share a transparency change we are making. In the coming months, we will allow people to see which users follow them.

We know that this may be a change from existing expectations, so we want to give you time to update your settings before moving forward with this. In the immediate future (starting Aug 19th, 2019), this will only affect new follows made. In about 3 months, we will make it possible to see your full list of followers. This would include follows made while profiles were in beta.

We plan to send a PM to all affected users, but wanted to make this public post as well so that you aren’t surprised when you receive it. To be clear, the usernames will only be visible to the user who was followed. No one will be able to look up your full list of subscriptions/follows and no one else will be able to see a list of followers of a profile.

If you are someone who follows other users, please take a second to examine your subscription/follow list and make sure you are comfortable with those users being aware that you follow them. If you are someone who has followers, we will make another post when the ability to view your followers has been released. We’ll stick around in the comments for a bit if you have questions. If there are other features you’d like to see for profiles, please let us know!

Thanks!

bpfyx1,SingShredCode,Introducing Custom Feeds (plus: a Community Contest with modest prizes!),1558030376.0,admin,1558033312.0,False,True,False,t3_bpfyx1,1039,False,8802,"Hello hello,

We’ve made some changes to Multireddits that we’d like to share with you. Also, a fun contest! Let’s get to it...

## What’s New

*New Name: Multireddits → Custom Feeds*

Multireddits have been around a [long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/). They are a way for redditors to curate communities into shareable feeds and can help newer redditors discover more communities. However, they haven’t been widely adopted. In order to prevent confusion, we will be changing the name from Multireddits to “Custom Feeds.” Sometimes simple is better.

*More Support*

We’ve added more support to new Reddit and our iOS app for Custom Feeds. Now, redditors can create a new Custom Feed, add or remove communities from them, duplicate other redditors' feeds, and change the privacy settings. Previously, this was something you could only do from old Reddit. We’ll be adding support for Custom Feeds on Android in the near future.

[iOS Screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/jox6inka4my21.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c92d7268dbcd46b35d6d2380b8316d4471dc1aac)

*New Follow Functionality*

You can now follow another redditor’s Custom Feed (as long as it’s set to Public). This means that when you follow a feed it will appear on your list of Custom Feed subscriptions and when that redditor adds another community to the feed, you’ll see that update the next time you open the feed. This will be super useful for communities that want to keep a running feed of related communities, or for folks that have a specific ever-evolving interest that they want to share with others.

[Follow on new Reddit](https://preview.redd.it/a6ztwd2b4my21.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=4576c32bf987c0dadf6a41024134387f96b45fb4)

*Improved Sharing*

We’ve made some tweaks to the URL structure of your Custom Feed so that it’s easier to share with others. No more accidentally sharing a URL with /me/ in it that won’t work for anyone else.  We’ve also created a new privacy category for public custom feeds, Hidden, that can be accessed by anyone with the link but will not show up on your profile.

*Spaces*

You can now have spaces in the name of your Custom Feed. [Enough said.](https://media.giphy.com/media/Wyt6sLEjKjaFjzybth/giphy.gif)

*Mix and Match*

Follow a mix of communities and profiles.

*Coming Soon*

In the near future communities will be able to create Custom Feeds that are owned by the community, rather than an individual. This will also support turning the Related Communities sidebar widget into a feed. We are also going to be building ways for you to see popular and trending Custom Feeds.

## The Contest

We are investing in this feature because we believe redditors are great at finding niche communities and we want more people to discover all of the unique communities that we have. Now for the [gold](https://media.giphy.com/media/30LbRh69K3fO/giphy.gif) part! We are holding a one-week contest for the best Custom Feeds created by redditors. The winners will receive Coins and bragging rights.

To submit your Custom Feed, reply to the top-level sticky comment with a link to your Custom Feed and the category it best fits under. **It must be public.** Please only submit one feed per category.

Here are the categories that we will award winners from:

* Aww
* Artist Resources
* Beauty
* Books & Writing
* Cool Pictures (images only)
* Discussion (text only)
* Fashion
* Food & Cooking
* Health & Fitness
* Music
* Parenting
* Quirky
* Sports
* Travel
* Wholesome

We’ll be picking winners based on a combination of the number of followers the feed has, how many upvotes their comment entry has, and our internal voting. Winners will be announced in a follow-up post next week.

Here are some custom feeds to get you started (many of which are mine):

* [Some of my favorite communities](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/singshredcodesubbies/)
* Some of my [voice and singing communities](https://www.reddit.com/user/singshredcode/m/voices/)

Today we’ve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018).

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

We’ve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didn’t disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. And—of course—we do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

I’ll hang around for a while to answer your questions.

–Steve

9uobsx,LastBluejay,It’s Election Day 2018 and We’ve Compiled Some Resources to Help You Vote,1541511226.0,admin,1541521813.0,False,True,False,t3_9uobsx,5358,False,35531,"Redditors of all stripes spend a lot of time talking about politics, and today is the day to take those views straight to the ballot box. It’s Election Day here in the US, and we want to help make sure that all registered voters get to the polls and make their voices heard. We’ve compiled some resources here to help you cast your ballot.

**Where do I vote?**

Your polling place is based on the address at which you registered. Polling places can be looked up through your state’s elections office ([find yours here](https://www.usa.gov/election-office)). These state websites are the most complete resources for all your voting needs.

There are also numerous quick lookup tools to find your polling place, voting hours, and even information about what’s on the ballot in your area. [The Voting Information Tool](https://gttp.votinginfoproject.org/) is one of the easiest to use.

**Do I need to already be registered to vote? And how can I see if I’m registered?**

It depends on your state. Some states allow for same-day registration, so **you may still be able to vote even if you haven’t registered**. You can [check your state’s registration requirements here](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/voter-registration). In most cases you’ll also be able to check your registration status on the same page.

**What do I need to bring with me?**

Some states require you to bring identification with you to the polls and some states don’t. You can see what your state’s requirements are [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect). **If your state requires identification and you don’t have it, you may still be able to vote, so still go to the polls.** Depending on your local laws, you may be able to cast a provisional ballot, show ID later, sign a form attesting your identity, or another method. Don’t assume that you can’t vote!

**What am I going to be voting on?**

Some people are surprised to find out when they get to the polls the sheer number of offices and issues they may be voting on. Don’t be caught unprepared! You can [look up a sample ballot for your area](https://www.ballotready.org/) to find out what you’ll be voting on, so that you’re informed when you head into the voting booth. You can even print out your sample ballot and take it to the poll with you so you can keep track of how you want to vote.

**I have a disability or language barrier. Can I still vote?**

Yes! There are federal laws in place to ensure that all eligible Americans can vote. You can [learn more about your rights and the accommodations you are entitled to here.](https://www.usa.gov/election-day#item-212487)

**Someone is trying to prevent me from voting or is deliberately spreading disinformation about voting. What should I do?**

Intimidating voters, trying to influence votes through threats or coercion, or attempting to suppress voters, including through misinformation campaigns, is against the law. If you witness such behavior, report it to your local election officials ([look up their contact info here](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm)). **If you see suspected voter suppression attempts on Reddit (eg efforts to deliberately misinform people about voting so that they won’t vote, or so that their vote might not count),** [**report it to the admins here**](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-request/investigations)**.**

**I have more questions about voting!**

DoSomething.org is back doing a [marathon AMA today](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9up8z2/we_are_experts_on_youth_voter_turnout_and_how/) with their experts in [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA) starting at 11am ET to answer all your additional voting questions.

Hello again!

It’s been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I’m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, you’ve probably noticed that over the past few months we’ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We’ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we’re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We’ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we’ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, we’ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to… night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven’t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I can’t imagine we have much to talk about, but I’ll hang to around some questions anyway.

9jf8nh,landoflobsters,Revamping the Quarantine Function,1538071918.0,admin,1538078852.0,False,True,False,t3_9jf8nh,8972,False,7887,"While Reddit has had a [quarantine](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits) function for almost three years now, we have learned in the process. Today, we are updating our quarantining policy to reflect those learnings, including adding an appeals process where none existed before.  

On a platform as open and diverse as Reddit, there will sometimes be communities that, while not prohibited by the [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy), average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting. In other cases, communities may be dedicated to promoting hoaxes (yes we used that word) that warrant additional scrutiny, as there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). In these circumstances, Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine. 

The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context.  We’ve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem. This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes.     

Quarantined communities display a warning that requires users to explicitly opt-in to viewing the content (similar to how the NSFW community warning works). Quarantined communities generate no revenue, do not appear in non-subscription-based feeds (eg Popular), and are not included in search or recommendations. Other restrictions, such as limits on community styling, crossposting, the share function, etc. may also be applied. Quarantined subreddits and their subscribers are still fully obliged to abide by Reddit’s [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) and remain subject to enforcement measures in cases of violation.  

Moderators will be notified via modmail if their community has been placed in quarantine. To be removed from quarantine, subreddit moderators may present an appeal [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com). The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful reform of the community. 

You can find more detailed information on the quarantine appeal and review process [here](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits).

This is another step in how we’re thinking about enforcement on Reddit and how we can best incentivize positive behavior.  We’ll continue to review the impact of these techniques and what’s working (or not working), so that we can assess how to continue to evolve our policies. If you have any communities you’d like to report, tell us about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/reddit.com) and we’ll review. Please note that because of the high volume of reports received we can’t individually reply to every message, but a human will review each one.

9ipbun,LastBluejay,It’s US National Voter Registration Day. Are You Registered?,1537851864.0,admin,1537893504.0,False,True,False,t3_9ipbun,4410,False,34034,"Voting is embedded in the Reddit experience. Yet offline, 1 in 4 eligible US voters isn’t registered. Even the most civically-conscious among us can unexpectedly find our registration lapsed, especially due to the wide variation in voter registration laws across the US. For example, did you know that you have to update your voter registration if you move, even if it’s just across town? Or that you also need to update it if you’ve changed your name (say, due to a change in marital status)? Depending on your state, you may even need to re-register if you simply haven’t voted in a while, even if you’ve stayed at the same address. 

Taken together, these and other factors add up to tens of millions of Americans every election cycle who need to update their registration and might not know it. This is why we are again teaming up with [Nonprofit VOTE](https://www.nonprofitvote.org/) to celebrate [National Voter Registration Day](https://nationalvoterregistrationday.org/) and help spread the word before the midterms this November.

You’ll notice a lot of activity around the site today in honor of the holiday, including amongst various communities that have decided to participate. If you see a particularly cool community effort, let us know in the comments. 

We’d also love to hear your personal stories about voting. Why is it important to you? What was your experience like the first time you voted? Are you registering to vote for the first time for this election? Join the conversation in the comments. 

Also check out the AMAs we have planned for today as well, including:

* [A bipartisan tag-team AMA with the Secretaries of State of Washington and Minnesota](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9is2zm/we_are_secretaries_of_state_steve_simon_mn_and/) in r/politics from 10am-12pm ET

Hey Everyone!

(And a very special *bonjour, hola, hallo, ciao, hej, sveiki, ahoj, buna,* and the rest to our European redditors in particular.)

It’s September, which means Europe’s back from vacation and we have an update for you on the EU copyright saga and its implications for the open Internet.

[When we last left you](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/) on July 5 (aka [Meme Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeDay/)), a truly disastrous version of the EU Copyright Directive was defeated, thanks primarily to the outpouring of concern from netizens rightfully worried about its implications for free expression. You’ll remember that because of the way the draft eliminated copyright liability protections for platforms, the proposed law would have radically changed how sites like Reddit work. It would have forced us to either cut off usage in Europe or install [error-prone copyright filters](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwkbad/this-music-theory-professor-just-showed-how-stupid-and-broken-copyright-filters-are) on your posts, resulting in a machine-censored user experience and striking a huge blow to the concept of the open Internet.

The July 5th “no” vote kicked the draft Directive back to the drawing board, and now a flurry of amendments have surfaced. Some are good, but some are just as bad as the original. For anyone who is interested in the nitty-gritty of the amendments, [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) has a [pretty good rundown of them here](https://juliareda.eu/2018/09/copyright-showdown/) (note, this issue is fast-moving and amendments are changing daily).

The bottom line is most of the amendments, short of the proposal to delete Article 13 all together, don’t make an appreciable difference from the last draft in terms of how they would force us to filter your posts (our friends at EDRi [break down why that is here](https://edri.org/copyright-compulsory-filtering-instead-of-obligatory-filtering-a-compromise/)).

The good news is, this measure—including whatever amendments are adopted—will go to a vote of the FULL European Parliament on September 12. This means that Every. Single. MEP. will have to vote on the record on this issue, and be accountable for that vote come election time. That’s why we’re participating in [A©tion Week](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) to spread the work and help people contact their MEPs. If you live in Europe, you can let your MEP know that this is an issue that you care about, and urge them to reject Article 13. The good folks at [SaveYourInternet.eu](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) have put together a wealth of resources for you to see how your country voted on July 5, look up your MEP, and share your views with them.

Check it out, and after you’ve called, let us know in the comments what your MEP office said!

EDIT: r/Europe has an awesome [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9el2ub/on_the_eu_copyright_reform_iv_second/) going on the vote, with lots of background information on the process itself. They have been THE place on Reddit to go for information on this whole process.",False,0.82,
9bvkqa,KeyserSosa,An update on the FireEye report and Reddit,1535736365.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_9bvkqa,5160,False,21007,"Last week, FireEye [made an announcement](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/08/suspected-iranian-influence-operation.html) regarding the discovery of a suspected influence operation originating in Iran and linked to a number of suspicious domains. When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.

* To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.
* This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.
* None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.
* More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).

Most (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:

* 3% (4) had negative karma
* 33% (47) had 0 karma
* 24% (35) had 1-999 karma
* 15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma
* 25% (36) had 10,000+ karma

To give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.  The example accounts include:

* [u/emilyward2017](https://www.reddit.com/user/emilyward2017)
* [u/Homaeefar](https://www.reddit.com/user/Homaeefar)
* [u/alessia\_80s](https://www.reddit.com/user/alessia_80s)
* [u/Anzfp](https://www.reddit.com/user/Anzfp)
* [u/jeremybernard](https://www.reddit.com/user/jeremybernard)
* [u/suarezanton](https://www.reddit.com/user/suarezanton)

Unlike our [last post on foreign interference](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), the behaviors of this group were different.  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran’s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.

Through this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we’ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.

We believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity. We're investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills. Skills they have acquired...you know the drill. Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you, but this is a battle we have been fighting, and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future. And of course, we’ll continue to communicate openly with you about these subjects.",False,0.78,
93qnm5,KeyserSosa,We had a security incident. Here's what you need to know.,1533141992.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_93qnm5,7648,False,73269,"**TL;DR**: A hacker broke into a few of Reddit’s systems and managed to access some user data, including some current email addresses and a 2007 database backup containing old salted and hashed passwords. Since then we’ve been conducting a painstaking investigation to figure out just what was accessed, and to improve our systems and processes to prevent this from happening again. 

**What happened?**

On June 19, we learned that between June 14 and June 18, an attacker compromised a few of our employees’ accounts with our cloud and source code hosting providers. Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept.  We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. 

Although this was a serious attack, the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems; they gained read-only access to some systems that contained backup data, source code and other logs. They were not able to alter Reddit information, and we have taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems.

Now that we've concluded our investigation sufficiently to understand the impact, we want to share what we know, how it may impact you, and what we've done to protect us and you from this kind of attack in the future.

**What information was involved?**

Since June 19, we’ve been working with cloud and source code hosting providers to get the best possible understanding of what data the attacker accessed. We want you to know about two key areas of user data that was accessed:

* **All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email addresses**
   * *What was accessed:* A complete copy of an old database backup containing very early Reddit user data -- from the site’s launch in 2005 through May 2007. In Reddit’s first years it had many fewer features, so the most significant data contained in this backup are account credentials (username + salted *hashed* passwords), email addresses, and all content (mostly public, but also private messages) from way back then.
   * *How to tell if your information was included:* We are sending a message to affected users and resetting passwords on accounts where the credentials might still be valid. If you signed up for Reddit after 2007, you’re clear here. Check your PMs and/or email inbox: we will be notifying you soon if you’ve been affected.
* **Email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018**
   * *What was accessed:* Logs containing the email digests we sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018. The logs contain the digest emails themselves -- they [look like this](https://i.redd.it/dtdpfncm6dd11.png). The digests connect a username to the associated email address and contain suggested posts from select popular and safe-for-work subreddits you subscribe to. 
   * *How to tell if your information was included:* If you don’t have an email address associated with your account or your “email digests” user preference was unchecked during that period, you’re not affected. Otherwise, search your email inbox for emails from [noreply@redditmail.com](mailto:noreply@redditmail.com) between June 3-17, 2018. 

As the attacker had read access to our storage systems, other data was accessed such as Reddit source code, internal logs, configuration files and other employee workspace files, but these two areas are the most significant categories of user data.

**What is Reddit doing about it?**

Some highlights. We:

* Reported the issue to law enforcement and are cooperating with their investigation.
* Are messaging user accounts if there’s a chance the credentials taken reflect the account’s current password. 
* Took measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddit’s systems are more secure (e.g., enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry since we suspect weaknesses inherent to SMS-based 2FA to be the root cause of this incident.)

**What can you do?**

First, check whether your data was included in either of the categories called out above by following the instructions there.

If your account credentials were affected and there’s a chance the credentials relate to the password you’re currently using on Reddit, we’ll make you reset your Reddit account password. Whether or not Reddit prompts you to change your password, think about whether you still use the password you used on Reddit 11 years ago on any other sites today. 

If your email address was affected, think about whether there’s anything on your Reddit account that you wouldn’t want associated back to that address. You can find instructions on how to remove information from your account on this [help page](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/removing-your-reddit-data).

And, as in all things, a strong unique password and [enabling 2FA](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication) (which we only provide via an authenticator app, not SMS) is recommended for all users, and be alert for potential phishing or scams.",False,0.85,

We’re constantly in awe of what redditors can accomplish when they join forces, from raising money [for children’s hospitals](https://redditblog.com/2017/10/04/extra-life-kicks-off-november-4th/) to shutting down the “inevitable” SOPA/PIPA. Today, European redditors, along with other concerned EU netizens, helped do the impossible once more. Thanks to the ruckus they raised with their Members of the European Parliament, [the flawed EU Copyright Directive has been sent back to the drawing board](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535874/eu-copyright-law-article-11-13-rejected-first-vote), ending (for now) the threats to subject all user uploads to automated content filtering, and require licensing fees for all links. 

There is no mistake that it was people power that made this happen. Before the vote, MEP Catherine Stihler of Scotland [noted](http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-parliament-rejects-sweeping-internet-copyright-reforms-2018-7) that she had received a petition signed by a million people against the changes. Other MEPs noted the deluge of calls and letters that they had received leading up to the vote. 

This outpouring of activism about what most people would have considered a dull procedural vote would not have been possible without the awareness and urgency (and, yes, [super-dank memes](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvny8v/some-genius-memers-are-creatively-fighting-the-eus-possible-meme-ban)) that members of the Reddit community raised, and we’d like to particularly congratulate r/Europe for leading the way. They hosted informative AMAs with [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) and Europe’s leading [independent experts on copyright reform](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8ugrow/eu_copyright_ama_we_are_professors_lionel_bently/), they kept everyone up to date on vote progress and outcomes (check out [their tally of the July 5th vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8wblrj/mep_votes_on_the_eu_copyright_directive_by_name/) to see how your MEP voted), and they [used megathreads](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8q1mfc/on_the_eu_copyright_reform/) to keep us all in the loop about what was happening and how to help. 

# What’s Next?

This isn’t over yet. The really important thing about this vote is that it takes what would have been pushed through into law behind closed doors and opens it up to a more public debate process, where citizens have the ability to weigh in, share their views, and build a compromise that protects rightsholders without imperiling free expression. 

The next vote will likely be on 10 September, and the coming weeks are critical to ensuring that the MEPs charged with hammering out amendments and drafting that compromise hear from their constituents.

In the decade-plus since then, you've demonstrated the power communities can have with news — analyzing articles, providing exposure to multiple perspectives, and having millions of discussions that bring context and insight to the conversation. You've shown us that news is an important part of how you use Reddit, but it's gotten harder to only get the news and related discussion, especially if you're subscribed to lots of non-news subreddits or browse [r/popular](https://www.reddit.com/r/popular) and [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all).

After hearing feedback from mods and iOS users and making a lot of improvements to the design and function of the tab along the way, **today we’re releasing it to the majority of iOS users as a beta**.

# What’s the News tab and how does it work?

[\(GIF of the News tab in action\)](https://i.redd.it/40c0ksw4wd511.gif)

The News tab offers a home for content that the community surfaces from a group of subreddits that frequently share and engage with the news. When you open the [Reddit iOS app](https://www.reddit.com/mobile/download), you'll find it to the left of ""Home"" and ""Popular."" The News tab content is then divided into a handful of common news topics -- like politics, science, and sports -- with options to customize your News tab by selecting the topics or subtopics that interest you most.

We took care to build the News experience around communities that were already engaging with news the most. We have set guidelines for the communities that filter into the experience, as well as the post type (for example: posts titles must reflect the article title). We’ll continue to expand the communities you see in News in Q3. For more on our guidelines, how we’ve been testing and collecting feedback in the News tab alpha on iOS, see our initial [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile/comments/8i7q2q/tldr_some_ios_users_will_see_a_news_tab_were/).

# What’s coming next?

So far, we have been testing the News experience in the iOS mobile app. Later this summer, we will be releasing it to desktop. Based on your feedback, we are also working on a few additional features. You told us you wanted more granular news topics (not just Sports but Baseball specifically), so we’ve introduced subtopics for you to personalize your News tab and notifications.   You all told us you want to be able to see how different communities are talking about the same story. So, we are developing a community pivot feature that will show you multiple threads from different communities on the same article.

We care deeply about protecting the free and open internet, and we know Redditors do too. Specifically, we’ve communicated a lot with you in the past year about the Net Neutrality fight in the United States, and ways you can help. One of the most frequent questions that comes up in these conversations is from our European users, asking what they can do to play their part in the fight. Well Europe, now’s your chance. Later this month, the European Parliament’s Legal Affairs Committee will [vote on changes](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44412025) to copyright law that would put untenable restrictions on how users share news and information with each other. The new Copyright Directive has two big problems:

* **Article 11** would create a ""link tax:” Links that share short snippets of news articles, even just the headline, could become subject to copyright licensing fees— pretty much ending the way users share and discuss news and information in a place like Reddit. 
* **Article 13** would force internet platforms to install automatic upload filters to scan (and potentially censor) every single piece of content for potential copyright\-infringing material. This law does not anticipate the difficult practical questions of how companies can know what is an infringement of copyright.  As a result of this big flaw, the law’s most likely result would be the effective shutdown of user\-generated content platforms in Europe, since unless companies know what is infringing, we would need to review and remove all sorts of potentially legitimate content if we believe the company may have liability.   

The unmistakable impact of both these measures would be an incredible chilling impact over free expression and the sharing of information online, particularly for users in Europe. 

Luckily, there are people and organizations in the EU that are fighting against these scary efforts, and they have organized a day of action today, June 12, to raise the alarm. 

Julia Reda, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) who opposes the measure, joined us last week for [an AMA on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/). In it, she offers a number of practical ways that Europeans who care about this issue can get involved. Most importantly, call your MEP and let them know this is important to you!

As a part of their Save the Link campaign, our friends at Open Media have created an [easy tool](https://act.openmedia.org/savethelink-call) to help you identify and call your MEP.

Here are some things you’ll want to mention on the phone with your MEP’s office:

* Share your name, location and occupation.
* Tell them you oppose Article 11 (the proposal to charge a licensing fee for links) and Article 13 (the proposal to make websites build upload filters to censor content).
* Share why these issues impact you. Has your content ever been taken down because of erroneous copyright complaints? Have you learned something new because of a link that someone shared?
* Even if you reach an answering machine, leave a message—your concern will still be registered.
* Be polite and SAY THANKS! Remember the human. 

Phone not your thing? Tweet at your MEP! Anything we can do to get the message across that internet users care about this is important. The vote is expected June 20 or 21, so there is still plenty of time to make our voices heard, but we need to raise them!

And be sure to let us know how it went! Share stories about what your MEP told you in the comments below.

Today we’re posting updates to our [User Agreement](https://reddit.com/help/useragreement) and [Privacy Policy](https://reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) that will become effective June 8, 2018.  For those of you that don’t know me, I’m one of the original engineers of Reddit, [left](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/dzl1o/and_like_that_poof_hes_gone/) and then returned in 2016 \(as was the style of the time\), and am currently CTO.  As a [very, very early redditor](https://i.redditmedia.com/Dhv5G_cwJajjHR7je79YL1POdrGa9h0OBd6KDK9X0X8.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=640&s=95a3befe0c3af1eaae3681fe39cec348), I know the importance of these issues to the community, so I’ve been working with our Legal team on ensuring that we think about privacy and security in a technical way and continue to make progress \(and are [transparent](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/) with all of you\) in how we think about these issues.

To summarize the changes and help explain the “why now?”:

* **Updated for changes to our services.**  It’s [been a long time](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2sk8i9/were_updating_the_reddit_privacy_policy_and_user/) since [our last significant User Agreement update](https://www.redditstatic.com/policy-changes/useragreement-2015-01-15.html).  In general, \*these\* revisions are to bring the terms up to date and to reflect changes in the services we offer. For example, some of the products mentioned in the terms we’re replacing are no longer available \(RIP redditmade and reddit.tv\), we’ve created a more [robust API process](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API), and we’ve launched [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) [new](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/891stx/starting_today_more_people_will_have_access_to/) [features](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7spq3s/protect_your_account_with_twofactor_authentication/)!
* **European data protection law.**  Many of the changes to the Privacy Policy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\). You might have heard about GDPR from such emails as “Updates to our Privacy Policy” and “Reminder: Important update to our Terms of Service & Privacy Policy.”  In fact, you might have noticed that just about everything you’ve ever signed up for is sending these sorts of notices.  We added information about the rights of users in the European Economic Area under the new law, the legal bases for our processing data from those users, and contact details for our legal representative in Europe.
* **Clarity.**  While these docs are longer, our terms and privacy policy do not give us any new rights to use your data; we are just trying to be more clear so that you understand your rights and obligations of using our products and services.  We rearranged both documents so that similar topics are in the same section or in closer proximity to each other.  Some of the sections are more concise \(like the Copyright, DMCA & Takedown section in the User Agreement\), although there has been no change to the applicable laws or our takedown policies.  Some of the sections are more specific.  For example, the new Things You Cannot Do section has most of the same terms as before that were in various places in the previous User Agreement.  Finally, we removed some repetitive items with our content policy \(e.g., “don’t mess with Reddit” in the user agreement is the same as our prohibition on “Breaking Reddit” in the content policy\).

Our work won’t stop at new terms and policies.  As CTO now and an infrastructure engineer in the past, I’ve been focused on ensuring our platform can scale and we are appropriately staffed to handle these gnarly issues and in particular, privacy and security.  Over the last few years, we’ve built a [dedicated anti\-evil team](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/) to focus on creating engineering solutions to help curb spam and abuse.  This year, we’re working on building out our dedicated security team to ensure we’re equipped to handle and can assess threats in all forms.

**Note**: Given that there's a lot to look over in these two updates, we've decided to push the date they take effect to June 8, 2018, so you all have two full weeks to review. And again, just to be clear, there are no actual product changes or technical changes on our end.

A straight\-up vampire? Or just a redditor that wants to browse in night mode? Then you’ll be happy to hear: Night Mode has \(finally\) landed so you can read Reddit without searing your retinas \(we heard it’s a thing\).

We want to give you guys more choice in how you browse new Reddit, and Night Mode has been a top feature request in the r/redesign community, so a few months ago we set out to build it.

...Annnnd now it’s been awhile since we first announced Night Mode was coming. Turns out creating and implementing a color system to incorporate a new theme is tough. But our design and engineering teams were undaunted: dive under the hood of the Design & Engineering effort to build Night Mode on the [blog](https://redditblog.com/2018/05/24/night-mode-is-finally-here/).

To start browsing Reddit in darkness, click on your username in the upper right hand corner, and then toggle it on. If you're on old Reddit, you can visit [http://new.reddit.com/](http://new.reddit.com/) to try out Night Mode. If you enjoy it, you can opt for it to be your default experience by selecting Opt In under Night Mode.

We hope you’ll enjoy this retina\-saving feature as much as we do. But seriously jokes aside, we are continuously trying to improve Reddit for y'all and we'll post more soon. Let us know your thoughts on Night Mode.

Hey Reddit, time for another update in the Net Neutrality fight!

When we [last checked in](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/80jsi9/upvote_the_downvote_tell_congress_to_use_the_cra/) on this in February, we told you about the [Congressional Review Act](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17314404/net-neutrality-cra-congressional-review-act-markey-senate), which allows Congress to undo the FCC’s repeal of Net Neutrality. That process took a big step forward today as the CRA petition was discharged in the Senate. That means a full Senate vote is likely soon, so let’s remind them that we’re watching!

[Today, you’ll see sites across the web go on “RED ALERT”](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/05/03/red-alert-net-neutrality-gains-steam-internet-heavyweights-back-campaign) in honor of this cause. Because this is Reddit, we thought that [Orangered](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=orangered) Alert was more fitting, but the call to action is the same. Join users across the web in [calling your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) \(both of ‘em!\) to let them know that you support using the Congressional Review Act to save Net Neutrality. You can learn more about the effort [here](https://netneutrality.internetassociation.org/action/).

We’re also delighted to share that Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the lead sponsor of the CRA petition, will be joining us for an AMA in r/politics today at 2:30 pm ET, hot off the Senate floor, so get your questions ready!

Finally, seeing [the creative ways the Reddit community gets involved](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) in this issue is always the best part of these actions. Maybe you’re the mod of a community that has organized something in honor of the day. Or you want to share something really cool that your Senator’s office told you when you called them up. Or maybe you’ve made the dankest of net neutrality\-themed memes. Let us know in the comments!

There is strength in numbers, and we’ve pulled off the impossible before through simple actions just like this. So let’s give those Senators a big, Reddit\-y hug.

8bb85p,spez,Reddit’s 2017 transparency report and suspect account findings,1523393172.0,admin,1523401877.0,False,True,False,t3_8bb85p,8082,False,19175,"Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddit’s latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal team’s efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we don’t consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&arh=2&w=960&s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(You’ll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

I’d also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). I’ve mentioned before that we’re cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, we’re going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. I’d like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70&#37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1&#37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22&#37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6&#37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1&#37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust & Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigation—all of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust & Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. It’s also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. I’ll stick around for a bit to answer questions.

And if you don’t like it, you can opt out.*

Our team has been hard at work redesigning our desktop site for more than a year. The main reasons [why we started this project in the first place](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) were to allow our engineers to build features faster and to make Reddit more welcoming.

**What’s happening today?**

Today, we’re beginning to give a small group of users access to the desktop redesign at random. We’re starting with a small group to test the load on our servers and plan to make the opt\-in available to everyone in the coming weeks. On behalf of the team, thank you for all of your comments, posts, bug tests, conversations with our designers, creative ideas, and other feedback over the past year. We are very proud of what we have accomplished together and we are excited for you to get [your hands on it](https://i.redd.it/oki81jw2tro01.gif).

Without further ado, and for those who don’t have access yet… here’s what the redesign looks like:

If you are one of the lucky few chosen to test out the redesign and prefer the existing Reddit experience, you can switch back and forth via a banner across the top or visit [old.reddit.com](http://reddit.com/). Furthermore, we do not have plans to do away with the current site. We want to give you more choices for how you view Reddit ^(we are looking at you i.reddit.com.)

**What’s next?**

As those of you who’ve given us redesign feedback already know, Reddit can be extremely complex. That said, we have not yet rebuilt all of our current features. We’re still iterating on your feedback and building more of the features you love \-\- such as native nightmode and keyboard shortcuts \-\-  plus more new features, which will arrive in the next few weeks. In the meantime, please keep the feedback coming and share your ideas for new features in the comments! It has been extremely helpful in shaping our roadmap, and we will continue building new features and making existing ones compatible in the redesign for the foreseeable future. We’ve made r/redesign the community dedicated for feedback on the redesign, public to everyone and post weekly updates on our progress there.

We’ll be hanging out in the comments to answer questions.

As you may have heard, we’ve been hard at work redesigning our desktop for the past year. In our previous four redesign blog posts, [u/Amg137](https://www.reddit.com/user/Amg137) and [u/hueylewisandthesnoos](https://www.reddit.com/user/hueylewisandthesnoos) talked about[ why we're redesigning](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign),[ moderation in the redesign](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded),[ our approach to design](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team), and[ Reddit’s evolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/84nyj6/a_shortish_history_of_new_features_on_reddit). Today, Reddit’s Engineering team invites you “under the hood” look at how we’re giving a long overdue update to Reddit’s core stack.

Spoiler: There’s going to be a fair bit of programming jargon in this post, but I promise we’ll get through it together.

**History and Journey**

For most of Reddit's history, the core engineering team supporting the site has been extremely small. Over its first five years, Reddit’s engineering team was comprised of just six employees. While there were some big engineering milestones in the early days—a [complete rewrite](https://redditblog.com/2005/12/05/on-lisp/) from Lisp to Python in 2006, then *another* Python rewrite \(aka “r2”\) in 2008, when we introduced jQuery. Much of the code that Reddit is running on right now is code that [u/spez](https://www.reddit.com/user/spez) wrote about ten years ago.

Given Reddit’s historically tiny eng team \(at one point it was literally just [u/spladug](/user/spladug)\), our code wasn’t always ideal... But before I get into how we've gone about fixing that, I thought it'd be fun to ask some of the engineers who have been here longest to share a few highlights:

* [u/spladug](https://www.reddit.com/user/spladug): ""For a while now, ‘The controller was now a giant mass of tendrils with an exciting twist’ has been the description of the r2 repository on GitHub.”
* [u/KeyserSosa](https://www.reddit.com/user/KeyserSosa): ""After being gone for 5 years and having first come back, I discovered that \(unsurprisingly\) part of the code review process is to use ‘git blame’ to figure out who last touched some code so they can be pulled into a code review. A couple of days in, I got pinged on a code review for some JS changes that were coming because I was the last one to edit the file \(one of the more core JS files we had\). Keeping in mind that during most of those intervening years I had switched from being ‘full stack’ to being pretty much focused on backend/infra/data, I was somewhat surprised \(and depressed\) to be looking at my old JS again. I let the reviewee \(a senior web dev\) know that in the future that he has carte blanche to make changes to anything in JS that has my blame on it because I know for a fact that that version of me was winging it and probably didn't know what I was doing.""
* [u/ketralnis](http://reddit.com/user/ketralnis): “I worked at Reddit from 2008 to 2011, then took a break and came back in 2016. When I returned my first project was to work on some performance stuff in our query caching. One piece was clearly incorrect in a way that had me concerned that the damage had spread elsewhere. I looked up who wrote it so I could go ask them what the deal was... and it was me.”

Luckily, Reddit's engineering team has grown *a lot* since those days, with most of that growth in the past two years. At our team’s current size, we're finally able to execute on a lot of the ideas you’ve given us over the years for fixes, moderation improvements \(like mod mode, bulk mod actions and removal reasons\), and new features \(like inline images in text posts and submit validation\). But even with a larger team, our ancient code base has made it extremely difficult to do this quickly and effectively.

Enter the redesign, the latest and most challenging rewrite of Reddit’s desktop code to date.

**Designing Engineering Networks that Neutralize Inevitable Snags**

Two years ago, engineers at Reddit had to work on complicated UI templated code, which was written in two different languages \(Javascript on the client and Python on the server\). The lack of separation of the frontend and backend code made it really hard to develop new features, as it took several days to even set up a developer environment. The old code base had a lot of inheritance pattern, which meant that small changes had a large impact and we spent much more time pushing those changes than we wanted to. For example, once it took us about a month to push a simple comments flat list change due to the complexity of our code base and the fact that the changes had to work well with CSS in certain communities, which we didn’t want to outright break.

When we set out to rewrite our code to solve these problems, we wanted to make sure we weren't just fixing small, isolated issues but creating a new, more modern frontend stack that allowed our engineering team to be nimble—with a componentized architecture and the scalability necessary to handle Reddit’s 330 million monthly users.

But above all, we wanted to use the rewrite as an opportunity to increase ""developer velocity,"" or the amount of time it takes an engineer to ship a fix or new feature. No more ""git blame"" for decade\-old code. Just a giant mass of tendrils, shipping faster than ever.

**The New Tech Stack**

These are the three main components we use in the redesign today:

* React is a Javascript library designed around the concept of reusable components. The components\-based approach scaled well as we were hiring and our teams grew. React also supports server side rendering, which was a key requirement for us.
* Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It greatly simplifies state management and has good performance.
* TypeScript is a language that functions as a superset of Javascript. It reduces type\-related bugs, has good built\-in tooling, and allows for easier onboarding of new devs. \(You can read more about why we chose TypeScript in [this post](https://redditblog.com/2017/06/30/why-we-chose-typescript/) by [u/nr4madas.\)](http://reddit.com/user/nr4madas)

**Just the Beginning**

With our new tech stack, we were able to ship a basic rewrite of our desktop site by September of last year. We’ve built a ton of features since then, addressing feedback we’ve gotten from a steadily growing number of users \(well, [a *mostly* steady number...](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittychangelog/comments/82jufo/reddit_change_loadtesting_the_redesign_by_turning/)\). So far, we’ve shipped over 150 features, we've fixed over 1,400 bugs, and we're moving forward at a rate of \~20 features and 200\+ bugs per month.

We know we still have work to do as Reddit has a very long tail of features. Fortunately, our team is already working on the majority of the most requested items \(like nightmode and keyboard shortcuts\), so you can expect a lot more updates from our team as more users begin to see the redesign—and because of our engineers’ work rewriting our stack over the past year, now we can ship these updates faster and more efficiently.

Over the past few weeks, we have given all moderators and beta users access to the redesign. Next week we plan to begin adding more users to make sure we can support a bigger user base on our new codebase. Users will have the option to keep the current design as their default if they wish—we do not want to force the redesign on anyone who doesn’t want to use it.

[Thank you](https://media3.giphy.com/media/IcGkqdUmYLFGE/giphy.gif) to everyone who’s helped test, reported bugs, and given feedback on the redesign so far; all of this helps a lot.

Over the past few months, we’ve talked a lot about our desktop redesign—[why we’re doing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/), [moderation/styling tools we’re adding](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/), and, most recently, [how you all have shaped our designs](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/). Today, we’re going to try something a little different. We’d like to take all of you on a field trip, [to the Museum of Reddit](https://i.redd.it/q6mjp4v3jyl01.png)!

When we started our work on the redesign over a year ago, we looked at pretty much every launch since 2005 to see what our team could learn from studying the way new features were rolled out in the past \(on Reddit [and other sites](http://i.imgur.com/AnWAj.png)\). So, before I preview another new feature our team has been working on, I want to share some highlights from the history books, for new redditors who may not realize how much the site has changed over the years and for those of you on your 12th cake day, who have seen it all.

**Trippin’ Through Time**

When Reddit launched back in June of 2005, it was a different time. Destiny’s Child was breaking up, Pink Floyd was getting back together, and Reddit’s front page [looked like this](https://i.redditmedia.com/oJ11JvxA3BkhXO0PpFpWXmIV2uh-BYR9EPZnVDq5LnA.png?fm=jpg&s=7e4e95ba4adabf6e145915d1c733f456).

In the site’s early days, [u/spez](/user/spez) and [u/kn0thing](/user/kn0thing) played around with the design in PaintShopPro 5, did the first user tests [by putting a laptop with Reddit on it in front of strangers at Starbucks](http://reddit.blogspot.com/2006/05/usability-testing-soy-lattes.html), and introduced the foundation of our desktop design, with a cleaned\-up look for the front page, a handful of sorting options, and our beloved alien mascot [Snoo](https://redditblog.com/2013/06/05/whats-snoo/).

As Reddit grew, the admins steadily rolled out changes that brought it closer to the Reddit you recognize today. \(Spoiler: Many of these changes were not received well at the time...\)

They launched commenting. \(The first comment, fittingly, was about how [comments are going to ruin Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/17913/reddit_now_supports_comments/c51/).\) They recoded the entire site [from Lisp to Python](https://i.redditmedia.com/48017v6J81HC92oyTdMISeYBB2220RuEHLnwgKxaiTE.png?fm=jpg&s=cf036e42ab63a0d7df8b7c882a312217).

And in 2008, they rolled out a beta for Reddit’s biggest change to date: [user\-created subreddits](https://redditblog.com/2008/01/22/new-features/).

It’s hard to imagine Reddit without subreddits now, but as a new feature, it [wasn’t without controversy](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/). In fact, many users felt that Reddit should be organized by tags, not communities, and [argued](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/1328g/upvote_if_you_want_to_get_rid_of_all_the/) [passionately](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/66kre/the_horror_of_subreddits_first_comes_applereddit/) [against](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/67gqd/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_subreddit_system/) [subreddits](http://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/68gcp/instead_of_these_subreddits_can_we_have_a_tagging/). \(Fun fact: That same year, the admins also launched [our first desktop redesign](https://redditblog.com/2008/05/26/reddit-design-changes-for-real-this-time/), which received its share of [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xpr/), [bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044xwp/), and [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6kury/reddit_design_changes_for_real_this_time/c044ybr/) reviews.\)

During those early years, Reddit had an extremely small staff that spent most of their time scaling the site to keep up with our growing user base instead of launching a lot of new features. But they did start taking some of the best ideas from the community and bringing them in\-house, moving Reddit Gifts from a user\-run project to an official part of Reddit and turning a [cumbersome URL trick](https://reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/bf1lh/are_you_aware_you_can_combine_subreddits_in_the/) people used to make multireddits into [a supported feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1iwd5i/new_create_and_share_your_own_collections_of/).

That approach of looking to the community first has shaped the features we’ve built in the years since then, like [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) \(my first project as an admin\), [video hosting](https://redditblog.com/2017/08/17/video-is-coming-to-reddit/), [mobile apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dqxgt/reddit_mobile_apps/), [mobile mod tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7l33mt/new_mod_tools_on_native_mobile/), [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/j1piv/moderators_give_your_users_some_flair/), [live threads](https://redditblog.com/2014/07/23/announcing-reddit-live/), [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5or86n/spoilers_tags_for_posts/), and [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7a5ubn/crossposting_coming_soon_to_your_subreddit/), to name a few.

**What Did We Learn? Did We Learn Things? Let's Find Out!**

Throughout all of these launches, two themes have stood out time and time again:

* You all have shown us millions of creative ways to use Reddit, and our best features have been the ones that unlock more user creativity.
* The best way to roll out a new feature is to get user feedback, early and often.

With the desktop redesign, we built structured styles so that anyone can give their subreddit a unique look and feel without learning to code. We revamped mod tools, taking inspiration from popular third\-party tools and CSS hacks, so mods can do things like [set post requirements](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif) and [take bulk actions](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif) more easily. And we engineered an entirely new tech stack to allow our teams to adapt faster in response to your feedback \(more on that in our next blog post about engineering!\).

**Previewing... Inline Images in Text Posts**

One feature we recently rolled out in the redesign is our Rich Text Editor, which allows you to format your posts without markdown and, for the first time, include inline images within text posts!

Like anything we’ve built in the past, we expect our desktop redesign to evolve a lot as we bring more users in to test it, but we’re excited to see all of the creative ways you use it along the way.

In the meantime, all mods now have access to the redesign, with invites for more users coming soon. \(Thank you to everyone who’s given feedback so far!\) If you receive an invite in your inbox, please take a moment to play around with the redesign and let us know what you think.

827zqc,spez,"In response to recent reports about the integrity of Reddit, I’d like to share our thinking.",1520273812.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_827zqc,22187,False,31127,"In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As it’s an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.

Given the recent news, we’d like to share some of what we’ve learned:

When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.

On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We don’t see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.

As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 2015–2016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.

The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\_GOP’s Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.

I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but it’s not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. It’s up to all of us—Redditors, citizens, journalists—to work through these issues. It’s somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what we’re going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.

Thank you for reading. While I know it’s frustrating that we don’t share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve.",False,0.61,
817lmi,hueylewisandthesnoos,TIL Reddit has a Design team,1519929846.0,admin,1519936268.0,False,True,False,t3_817lmi,2366,False,18878,"In our previous two blog posts, [u/Amg137](/user/Amg137) talked about [why we’re redesigning Reddit on desktop](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) and [how moderation and community styling will work in it](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/). Today, I’m here as a hu~~man sacrifice m~~ember of Reddit’s Design team \(surprise: designers actually work at Reddit!\) to talk about how we’ve approached the desktop redesign and what we’ve learned from your feedback along the way.

When approaching the redesign, we all learned early on that this wasn’t just about making Reddit more usable, accessible, and efficient; it was also about learning how to interact, adapt, and communicate with the world’s largest, most passionate and genuine community of users.

# Better every (feedback) loop

Every team working on this project has its share of longtime redditors—whether it's Product, Design, Engineering, or Community. To say that this has been the most challenging \(and rewarding\) project of our careers is an understatement. Over the past year we’ve been running surveys internally and externally. We’ve conducted video conferences with first\-time users, redditors on their 10th Cake Day, moderators, and lurkers. Not to mention an extremely helpful community of alpha testers. You all have shaped the way we do every part of our jobs, from brainstorming and creating designs to building features and collecting feedback.

Just when we thought we had the optimal approach to a new feature or legacy functionality, you came in and told us where we were wrong and, in most cases, explained to us with passion and clarity why a given feature was important to you—like [making Classic and Compact views fill your screen](https://media1.tenor.com/images/782ba18e2ff1bb49a36ade1ab90f2869/tenor.gif?itemid=7549364) \(coming soon\).

# What? Reddit is evolving!

Reddit is not a one\-size\-fits\-all experience. It’s a site based on choice and evolution. There are millions of you, spread across different devices, joining Reddit at different times, using the site in widely varying ways, and we're trying to build in a way that supports all of you. So, as we figured out the best way to do that, these are the themes that guided us along the way:

* Maintain and extend what makes Reddit, Reddit
   * [Give communities tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7xjt6g/because_its_valentines_day_heres_a_longwinded/) that are simple, intuitive, and flexible—for styling, moderating, communicating subreddit rules, and customizing how each community organizes its content.
* Make our desktop experience more welcoming
   * Lower the barrier to entry for new redditors, while providing choice \(e.g., different viewing options: [Card](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif) / [Classic](https://i.redd.it/q3ysf2phhnd01.gif) / [Compact](https://i.redd.it/4egg3y5lhnd01.gif)\) and familiarity to all users.
* Design a foundation for the future
   * Establish a design foundation that encourages user insight and allows our team to make improvements quickly, release after release.
* Keep content at the forefront
   * We want to make sure viewing, posting, and interacting with content is easy by keeping our UI and brand elements minimal.

# Asking Reddit

As we moved from setting high\-level goals to getting into the actual design work, we knew it would be a long process even with the learnings we gained from the initial look\-see. We know that our first attempt is never the best, and the only way we can improve is by talking directly with all of you. It’s hard to summarize everything we built as a result of these conversations, but here are a few examples:

* Navigation: We wanted to make Reddit simpler to navigate for everyone, so after receiving feedback from our alpha testers, we developed a “hamburger menu” on the left sidebar that made it easy to do everything users wanted it to: quickly find your favorite subreddits and subreddits you moderate, and [filter all of your subscriptions just by typing in a few letters](https://i.redd.it/1is6htgra3j01.gif).
* Posting flow: The current interface for submitting text and link posts \(aka “Create a post”\) can be confusing for new redditors, so we wanted to simplify it and make some long overdue improvements that would address a wide variety of use cases. While users liked the more intuitive look and formatting options we introduced, they gave us additional feedback that led to changes like submit validation, clearly displayed subreddit rules, and options for adding spoiler tags, NSFW tags, and post flair directly when you’re creating.
* Listings pages: We know from RES and our mobile apps that many users like an expanded Card View while many longtime users prefer our classic look, so we decided early on that the redesign should offer choice in how users view Reddit. We’ve received a lot of feedback on how each view could be improved \(e.g., reducing whitespace in Classic\), and we’re working on shipping fixes.

The list of user\-inspired changes goes on and on \(and we’re expecting a lot more *i*teration as we expand our testing pool\), but this is how we’ve worked through design challenges so far.

# It’s [never over](https://media.giphy.com/media/fQvND2Wo28q9a/giphy.gif)

The redesign isn’t finished at “GA” \(General Availability, or as I like to call it, “Time to Breathe for One Day Before We Get Back to Work”\). With this post, we wanted to share some context on our approach, thank everyone who's participated in r/redesign so far \(THANK YOU!\), and let you know we will continue to engage with you on a daily basis to understand how you’re responding to what we’re building.

Over the next several weeks, we'll be expanding the number of users who have access to the alpha \(yes, you will be able to opt out if you prefer the current desktop look\), hearing what you think, and updating all of you as we make more changes.

80jsi9,arabscarab,Upvote the Downvote: Tell Congress to use the CRA to save net neutrality!,1519707605.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_80jsi9,4771,False,161937,"Hey, Reddit! 

It’s been a couple months since the FCC voted to repeal federal net neutrality regulations. We were all disappointed in the decision, but we told you we’d continue the fight, and we wanted to share an update on what you can do to help. 

The debate has now moved to Congress, which is good news. Unlike the FCC, which is unelected and less immediately accountable to voters, members of Congress depend on input from their constituents to help inform their positions—especially during an election year like this one. 

“But wait,” you say. “I already called my Congressperson last year, and we’re still in this mess! What’s different now?” Three words: **Congressional Review Act.**

# What is it?

The Congressional Review Act \(CRA\) is basically Congress’s downvote. It lets them undo the FCC’s order through a “resolution of disapproval.” This can be formally introduced in both the Senate and the House within 60 legislative days after the FCC’s order is officially published in the Federal Register, which happened last week. It needs a simple majority in both houses to pass. Our friends at Public Knowledge have made [a video explaining the process](https://youtu.be/VABCjxFtRnI).

# What’s happening in Congress?

Now that the FCC order has been published in the Federal Register, the clock for the CRA is ticking. Members of both the House and Senate who care about Net Neutrality have already been securing the votes they need to pass the resolution of disapproval. In fact, the Senate version is only [**#onemorevote**](https://www.battleforthenet.com/onemorevote/) away from the 51 it needs to pass! 

# What should I do?

Today, we’re calling on you to phone your members of Congress and tell them what you think! You can see exactly where members stand on this issue so far on [this scoreboard](https://www.battleforthenet.com/scoreboard/). If they’re already on board with the CRA, great! Thank them for their efforts and tell them you appreciate it. Positive feedback for good work is important.

If they still need convincing, here is a script to help guide your conversation:

“My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and I live in \_\_\_\_\_\_. I’m calling today to share my support for strong net neutrality rules. I’d like to ask Senator/Representative\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to use the CRA to pass a resolution of disapproval overturning the FCC’s repeal of net neutrality.”

# Pro tips:

\-**Be polite**. That thing your grandma said about the flies and the honey and the vinegar is right. Remember, the people who disagree with us are the ones we need to convince. 

\-**Only call the Senators and Representatives who actually represent YOU**. Calls are most effective when they come from actual constituents. If you’re not sure who represents you or how to get in touch with them, you can look it up [here](https://www.publicknowledge.org/act-now/tell-congress-to-use-the-cra-to-save-net-neutrality/#anchor).

\-**If this issue affects you personally because of who you are or what you do, let them know!** Local business owner who uses the web to reach customers? Caregiver who uses telemedicine to consult patients? Parent whose child needs the internet for school assignments? Share that. The more we can put a human face on this, the better.

\-**Don’t give up.** The nature of our democratic system means that things can be roundabout, messy, and take a long time to accomplish. Perseverance is key. We’ll be with you every step of the way.",False,0.81,
7xjt6g,Amg137,Because it’s Valentine’s Day… here’s a long-winded blog post about moderation and community styling in the redesign!,1518630409.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_7xjt6g,1822,False,8431,"Hi All,

Two weeks ago, we [kicked off our blog series](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) to take you behind the scenes of the redesign. As I mentioned last week, we wanted to put communities first from the beginning of our redesign efforts, so today we're going to get into some of the specifics of what that actually looks like.

Fun fact: When Reddit first launched, user\-created subreddits weren't even an option. In the years since the very first ones were created, our communities have shown us thousands of creative ways to use Reddit. The most important things we wanted to bring to the core Reddit experience were the creative styling and moderation tricks and tools that you all have pioneered over the years.

Without further ado, here are some of the community features we've been working to support natively in the redesign.

# Features inspired by the community

[**Image Flair - Emojis**](https://i.redditmedia.com/Tk7MR1_C8WtRpgrtnQfM4qziSIsS7q5S1lirkhcMlZo.png?s=048534b6d6837c5a0d2c708b34d2fe3f)

Giving community members a sense of identity through unique flair is critical for many subreddits. Today, many subreddits use image flair to bring out this sense of community, like [r/baseball](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball)'s team logo flair and [r/WoW](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoW)'s faction icons. To make this process simpler, we’re introducing subreddit emojis. Now, every subreddit can upload emojis in the redesign, which community members can use in their post and user flair.

[**Submit Validation**](https://i.redd.it/b6ubx3lpy6g01.gif)

Moderators work hard to maintain the quality of their community. With the new Post Requirements, moderators can specify certain guidelines that a post has to abide by, such as requiring flair or title length restrictions. Users will be notified prior to submitting their posts so they aren’t confused by the rules when posting in a new community, they have the opportunity to fix their errors, and so moderators can spend less time addressing posts that don't meet these guidelines.

[**Flair Filtering**](https://i.redditmedia.com/ERuv8BBJBhRL28_cexQVDulJ2q2djLR9tiSCoLmC7iw.png?s=22b5edba1b74e4e1ef604057907f7509)

Many subreddits use post flair to allow users to sort through different types of content in their communities. [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance) uses flair filtering to help users search posts on specific topics like retirement and budgeting, [r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop) uses flair to filter answered and unanswered questions, and other communities have put their own unique twists on this idea. Despite the usefulness of these filters, they can be very difficult to set up through CSS. Going forward, we’ll support filtering posts by flair as a native feature in the redesign.

**Sidebar**

Many mod teams use the sidebar to share information and resources with their community members, from the network of wholesome subreddits listed in the sidebar of [r/WholesomeMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/WholesomeMemes) to [r/IAmA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA)'s schedule of upcoming AMAs. Unfortunately, for most redditors, maximizing this sidebar space in creative ways isn't very easy or intuitive. As we thought about how we wanted styling to work in the redesign, we looked at some of the most common sidebar hacks that communities have already been doing for years and worked to support those natively through widgets. Right now, styling in the redesign includes [text widgets](https://i.redd.it/7u6ttrufr6g01.png), [button widgets](https://i.redd.it/117hrvjx6af01.png), [image widgets](https://i.redd.it/uhg3r378s6g01.png), [a calendar widget](https://i.redd.it/t2l2jrhy6af01.png), [a related communities widget](https://i.redd.it/8kfygo3y6af01.png), and [a rules widget](https://i.redd.it/grx7kklsr6g01.png). But we’re not stopping there! We're going to continue to add more advanced options in the coming months.

# Features inspired by 3rd-party tools

Communities themselves aren’t the only ones that have inspired us; we also had the help of some great developers that build 3rd\-party tools such as Toolbox and Reddit Enhancement Suite \(RES\).

**Toolbox:** [**Bulk Mod Actions**](https://i.redd.it/6mdi08dltnwz.gif)

Moderating subreddits with a high volume of activity can be difficult, and next to impossible without the help of third\-party tools. To make things easier, we've been working to improve our native mod tools, both in our apps and in the redesign. Instead of taking one action at a time, you can now moderate multiple posts or comments at once. You’ll also be able to switch between different community mod queues with ease.

**RES:** [**Show All Images \(aka Card View\)**](https://i.redd.it/et5p9bxbhnd01.gif)

RES has enhanced Reddit’s expandos \(i.e., embedded media like images, videos, and gifs\) for years, and one of the most popular features has been “show all images” \(i.e., expand all the things!\). The redesign has embraced this feature with Card View, a browsing option that allows you to easily view each post’s images, videos, and text with no more effort than scrolling down the page.

**RES:** [**User Info Cards** **\(inline banning/muting\)**](https://i.redd.it/q070hj0yv6g01.gif)

When cruising through posts and comments, redditors are only their usernames and the content they’ve posted. RES has provided a little more context by allowing you to see that user’s stats \(like account age and karma score\) and interact with them in context. Reddit has picked up that same idea and added even more content like avatar and bio—plus actions for moderators such as banning or muting without having to visit another page.

**Toolbox:** [**Removal Reasons**](https://i.redd.it/kvl429ent6g01.gif)

Over the years, Toolbox has built some amazing features that have simplified moderation. As a Toolbox\-inspired effort to improve our own mod tools, we’re pleased to support removal reasons as a native feature in the redesign. \(Note for existing Toolbox users: Throughout our redesign process, we also worked with the toolbox team to make sure they have everything they need to make sure Toolbox features work in the redesign.\)

**Styling**

Today it can require a lot of expertise to style a community. [Custom CSS is complicated, breaks in different places, and doesn’t work on mobile.](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-41v6n3Vaf5s/UeRN_XJ0keI/AAAAAAAAN2Y/YxIHhddGiaw/s1600/css.gif) With more of our users shifting to mobile each year and many communities remaining unstyled because CSS is too complicated, we wanted to build a system that would give moderators a high level of customization without requiring CSS. \(But don't worry: As we said before, we will also give you the option to use CSS enhancements in the redesign. This is still in development.\)

With these new features, we're excited to say that [styling a community is much easier](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Amg137/comments/7xizbv/how_to_style_a_subreddit/). Some mod teams have already shown how creative you can get with structured styles, like [r/AskReddit](https://i.redd.it/s3lr1sycy6g01.png), [r/CasualConversation](https://i.redd.it/1jpoy9nlx6g01.png), [r/Greenday](https://i.redd.it/315q8lx9x6g01.png), [r/ITookAPicture](https://i.redd.it/9pscr3i1y6g01.png), and [r/NASCAR](https://i.redd.it/81sh2ut5x6g01.png). We're looking forward to seeing more of you test out the new styling.

**Join the Redesign!**

Over the next few weeks, we’ll be rolling out invitations widely for more moderators to start exploring these tools, styling their communities, and providing feedback for us to iterate on. Moderators, we know you need some time to get your communities styled before we let more users into the redesign, so keep an eye out for more updates soon in [r/modnews](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews).",False,0.71,

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and we’re especially pleased to see features that didn’t exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback.

We’ve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often we’re catching issues before they become issues. I’d like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T&S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons I’ve learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(I’m serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, we’ll continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

It’s still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but we’re excited about the progress we’ve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If you’d like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. We’ll be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

We’re super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

Today, all Reddit users have the option to enable [two-factor authentication](https://i.redd.it/2y66bw0sapb01.gif) for an additional layer of account security.

We have been [slowly rolling this feature out](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/7bfoqg/twofactor_authentication_now_available_for/), starting with beta testers, moderators, and third-party app developers, to ensure a positive experience across devices. Your feedback has been incredibly valuable, from pointing out bugs to recommending features. Thank you to everyone involved in testing.

Two-factor adds more security to your Reddit account by requiring a second step to sign in. In this case, if you opt into 2FA, you’ll access a 6-digit verification code generated by your phone after a new sign-in attempt.

With two-factor enabled, even if someone else obtained your Reddit username and password, they still could not log in as you.

You can enable two-factor by selecting the [password/email](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/) tab under your preferences on desktop. Select **enable** under _two-factor authentication_ and follow the steps given to you. And make sure to generate your backup codes in the event your phone is unavailable! You can find more help in our [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/using-reddit/your-reddit-account/how-set-two-factor-authentication).

Two-factor is supported across desktop, mobile, and third-party apps. It requires an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, or any app supporting the TOTP protocol) to generate your 6-digit verification code.

A few handy security reminders:

* Choose a strong and unique password. We recommend at least 8 characters. And don’t reuse the same password on Reddit as other sites!
* Add a verified email address. Email is the only way for us to reset your account. (We do require a verified email for setting up two-factor authentication since the account can be lost if, for example, you lose your phone).
* Check your [account activity](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity) for recent logins. It’s a good idea to look at this page from time to time to make sure there’s nothing fishy going on.

When we first launched our native mobile apps in April 2016, we started with a pretty basic set of features that would give you a portable way to discuss and browse the things you love on Reddit. Since that time, we’ve made a lot of improvements and added in features to let you do more. 

This week, we released major updates to both our native apps: [version 4.0 on iPhone and iPad](https://www.reddit.com/user/dmoneyyyyy/comments/7kmm1u/reddit_for_iphone_and_ipad_40/), and version 2.22 on Android. 

These are **the** biggest updates we’ve made to the apps since launch — they’re packed with some brand new features including mod tools that we’re stoked for you to try. 

For more info and full feature lists, check out the official threads for each platform: [iOS here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7kmu9v/reddit_for_ios_40_version_now_available11) and [Android here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7l32an/reddit_for_android_222_version_now_available11/).

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users’ everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC’s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, today’s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We don’t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC’s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It’s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren’t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isn’t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you’ve created. Those who thought that they’d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We’ll keep you informed as things develop.

It’s been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought I’d check in and share a few updates.

It’s been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddit’s web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which we’ll be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. We’ve got a long way to go, but the feedback we’ve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If you’d like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, we’ll be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. We’ve made many other changes as well, and if you’re interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go…\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade “inciting violence,” but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We don’t take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

We’ve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

We’re happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far it’s been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. It’s incredible how much we’re building, and we’re excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. We’re creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I can’t wait for you all to see what we’re working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

We’re making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, we’re phasing out Do Not Track, which isn’t supported by all browsers, doesn’t work on mobile, and is implemented by few—if any—advertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers don’t catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust & Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means we’re catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, I’ll stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, I’ll be here a couple hours.

6eh6ga,simbawulf,Reddit's new signup experience,1496257701.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_6eh6ga,5062,False,29181,"Hi folks,
 
**TL;DR People creating new accounts won't be subscribed to 50 default subreddits, and we're adding subscribe buttons to Popular.**

 
Many years ago, we realized that it was difficult for new redditors to discover the rich content that existed on the site. At the time, our best option was to select a set of communities to feature for all new users, which we called (creatively), “the defaults”.  

Over the past few years we have seen a wealth of diverse and healthy communities grow across Reddit. The default communities have done a great job as the first face of Reddit, but at our size, we can showcase many more amazing communities and conversations. We recently launched r/popular as a start to improving the community discovery experience, with extremely positive results. 
 

New users will land on “Home” and will be presented with a quick [tutorial page](https://i.redd.it/77yt9bbojv0z.png) on how to subscribe to communities.

On “Popular,” we’ve made subscribing easier by adding [in-line subscription buttons](https://i.redd.it/ccdmg3aujv0z.png) that show up next to communities you’re not subscribed to.


To the communities formerly known as defaults - thank you.  You were, and will continue to be, awesome. To our new users - we’re excited to show you the breadth and depth our communities!

63974m,spez,It's that time of year again. We just published our 2016 Transparency Report.,1491249512.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_63974m,4733,False,29666,"Hello Everyone,

We just posted our [2016 Transparency Report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2016). It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).

Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddit’s commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.

Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.

Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.

We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebook’s arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.

Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (“Knight”) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial court’s order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230’s immunity. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.

I’ll answer any questions that I can, but please understand I can’t always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

Reddit is the home to the most amazing content creators on the internet. Together, we create a place for artists, writers, scientists, gif-makers, and countless others to express themselves and to share their work and wisdom. They fill our days with beautiful photos, witty poems, thoughtful AMAs, shitty watercolours, and scary stories. Today, we make it easier for them to connect directly to you.


Reddit is testing a new profile experience that allows a handful of users, content creators, and brands to post directly to their profile, rather than to a community. You’ll be able to follow them and engage with them there. We’re excited because having this new ability will give our content contributors a home for their voice on Reddit. This feature will be available to everyone as soon as we iron out the kinks.


##What does it look like?
* Check-out u/Shitty_Watercolour’s new profile page: http://www.reddit.com/user/shitty_watercolour where he’s doing an AMA. 
* Reddit co-founder u/kn0thing is also participating as an alpha user: you gotta eat your own dogfood: http://www.reddit.com/user/kn0thing 
* Riot Games is participating under u/LeagueOfLegends where they will be engaging their fans with AMAs and patch feedback threads: http://www.reddit.com/user/leagueoflegends  
* On our mobile apps, you can search for “shitty_watercolour”, “kn0thing”, “leagueoflegends” and you’ll see them as u/shitty_watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/leagueoflegends ([example](https://i.redd.it/nd9dn34ixrmy.png)) 

##What is it?
* A new profile page experience that allows you to follow other redditors
* Selected redditors will be able to post directly to their profile
* We worked with some moderators to pick a handful of redditors to test this feature and will slowly roll this out to more users over the next few months 

##Who is this for?
* We want to build this feature for all users but we’re starting with a small group of alpha testers. 

##How does it work?
* You will start to see some user profile pages with new designs (e.g. u/Shitty_Watercolour, u/kn0thing, u/LeagueOfLegends).
* If you like what they post, you can start to follow them, much as you subscribe to communities. This does not impact our “friends” feature.
* You can comment on their profile posts
* Once you follow a user, their profile posts will start to show up  on your front-page. Posts they make in communities will only show up on your frontpage if you subscribe to that community. 

##What’s next?
* We’re taking feedback on this experience on r/beta and will be paying close attention to the voices of community members. We want to understand what the impact of this change is to Reddit’s existing communities, which is why we’re partnering with only a handful of users as we slowly roll this out. 
* We’ll ramp up the number of testers to this program based on feedback from the community (see application sections below) 

##How do I participate?
* If you want to participate as a beta user please fill out this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT).
* If you want to nominate a fellow redditor, please use this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). 

##TL;DR: 

We’re testing a new profile page experience with a few Redditors (alpha testers). They’ll be able to post to their profile and you’ll be to follow them. Send us bugs or feedback specific to the feature on in r/beta!

------------

##Q&A:

**Q: Why restrict this to just a few users?**

A: This is an early release (“alpha”) product and we want to make sure everything is working optimally before rolling it out to more users. We picked most of our initial testers from the gaming space so we can work closely with a core group of mods that can provide direct feedback to us.

----

**Q: Who are the initial testers and how were they selected?**

A: We reached out to the moderators of a few communities and the testers were recommended to us based on the quality of their content and engagement. The testers include video makers, e-sports journalists, commentators, and a game developer. 

---

**Q: When will this roll out to everyone?**

A: If all goes well, over the course of the next few months. We want to do this roll-out carefully to avoid any disruptions to existing communities. This is a major product launch for Reddit and we’re looking to the community to give us their input throughout this process.

---

**Q: What about pseudo-anonymity?**

A: Users can still be pseudonymous when posting to their profile. There’s no obligation for a user to reveal their identity. Some redditors choose not to be pseudonymous, in the case of some AMA participants, and that’s ok too.

---

**Q: How will brands participate in this program?**

A: During this alpha stage of the rollout, our testers are users, moderators, longtime redditors, and organizations that have a strong understanding of Reddit and a history of positive engagement. They are selected based on how well how they engage with redditors and there is no financial aspect to our initial partnerships. We are only working with companies that understand Reddit and want to engage our users authentic conversations and not use it as another promotional platform.

We’re specifically testing this with Riot Games because of how well they participate in r/LeagueOfLegends and demonstrated a deep understanding of how we expect companies to engage on Reddit. Their interactions in the past have been honest, thoughtful, and collaborative. We believe their direct participation will add more great discussions to Reddit and demonstrate a new better way for brands and companies to converse with their fans.

---

**Q: What kinds of users will be allowed to create these kinds of profiles? Is this product limited to high-profile individuals and companies?**

A: Our goal is to make this feature accessible to everyone in the Reddit community. The ability to post to profile and build a following is intended to enhance the experience of Reddit users everywhere — therefore, we want the community to provide feedback on how the launch is implemented. This product can’t succeed without being useful for redditors of every type.  We will reach out to you for feedback in the r/beta community as we grow and test this new product. 

---

**Q: Will this change take away conversations and subscribers from existing communities?**

A: We believe the value of the Reddit experience comes from two different but related places: engaging in communities and engaging with people. Providing a platform for content creators to more easily post and engage on Reddit should spur more interesting conversations everywhere, not just within their profile. We’re also testing a new feature called “Active in these Communities” on the tester’s profile page to encourage redditors to discover and engage with more communities.

---

**Q: Are you worried about giving individual users too much power on Reddit?**

A: This is one reason that we’re being so careful about how we’re testing this feature — we want to make sure no single user becomes so powerful that it overpowers the conversation on Reddit. We will specifically look to the community for feedback in r/beta as the product develops and we onboard more users.

**Q: The new profile interface looks very similar to the communities interface, what’s the difference between the two?**

A: Communities are the interest hubs of Reddit, where passionate redditors congregate around a subject area or hobby they share a particular interest in. Content posted to a profile page is the voice of a single user.

---

**Q: What about the existing “friends” feature?**

A: We’re not making any changes to the existing “friends” feature or r/friends.

---

**Q: Will Reddit prevent users with a history of harassment from creating one of these profiles?**

A: Content policy violations will likely impact a user's ability to create an updated profile page and use the feature. We don’t want this new platform to be used as a vehicle for harassment or hate.

---

**Q: I’m really opposed to the idea and I think you should reconsider. What if you’re wrong?**

A: We don’t have all of the answers right now and that’s why we’re testing this with a small group of alpha users. As with any test, we’re going to learn a lot along the way. We may find that our initial hypothesis is wrong or you may be pleasantly surprised. We won’t know until we try and put this front of our users. Either way, the alpha product you see today will evolve and change based on feedback.

---

**Q: How do I participate in this beta?**

A:  We’ll be directly reaching out to redditors we think will be a great fit. We’re also taking direct applications via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/j8NizT) or you can nominate a fellow redditor via this [survey](https://reddit-survey.typeform.com/to/ArhT7l). ",False,0.52,

Back in the day, the original version of the front page looked an awful lot like r/all.  In fact, it *was* r/all.  But, when we first released the ability for users to [create subreddits](https://redditblog.com/2008/03/12/make-your-own-reddit/), those new, nascent communities had trouble competing with the larger, more established subreddits which dominated the top of the front page.  To mitigate this effect, we created the notion of the defaults, in which we *cherry picked* a set of subreddits to appear as a default set, which had the effect of editorializing Reddit. 

Over the years, Reddit has grown up, with hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of active communities, each with enormous reach and great content. Consequently, the “defaults” have received a disproportionate amount of traffic, and made it difficult for new users to see the rest of Reddit. We, therefore, are trying to make the Reddit experience more inclusive by launching r/popular, which, like r/all, opens the door to allowing more communities to climb to the front page. 

**Logged out users will land on “popular” by default and see a large source of diverse content.  
Existing logged in users will still maintain their subscriptions.**

##How are posts eligible to show up “popular”?
First, a post must have enough votes to show up on the front page in the first place. 
Post from the following types of communities will not show up on “popular”:  

* NSFW and 18+ communities
* Communities that have opted out of r/all
* A handful of subreddits that users [consistently filter](https://i.redd.it/vxybnlltm2gy.gif) out of their r/all page
  

##What will this change for logged in users?
Nothing! Your frontpage is still made up of your subscriptions, and you can still access r/all. If you sign up today, you will still see the 50 defaults. We are working on making that transition experience smoother. If you are interested in checking out r/popular, you can do so by clicking on the link on the gray nav bar the top of your page, right between “FRONT” and “ALL”. 
  

**TL;DR:** We’ve created a new page called “popular” that will be the default experience for logged out users, to provide those users with better, more diverse content. 
  

Thanks, we hope you enjoy this new feature!

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year ago—especially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you haven’t given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.

As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.

We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.

One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!

Reddit is a great place to discuss the things you love.  And right now the culture industry is working overtime to pump out oodles of the things you love.  Whatever these passions, you can find a community on Reddit that is as excited about them as you are.  That could be:

- Discussing the [r/StarWars](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/) universe at length 
- Following Worlds in [r/leagueoflegends](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/) 
- Ruminating on the whereabouts of Gendry in r/gameofthrones
- Watching [the showrunner get involved](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/comments/5d0zee/the_real_question_no_one_is_asking/da1zzsl) in the fan theorizing on [r/westworld](https://www.reddit.com/r/westworld/) 
- Getting excited about the long awaited Japanese release of [r/KingdomHearts](https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/) 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue 
- Speculating on the upcoming season of [r/twinpeaks](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/) 

However, you might want to participate in a community where you aren’t up-to-date on the latest happenings.  Enter spoiler tags (an [oft-requested](https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/search?q=spoiler&sort=new&restrict_sr=on) feature).  

OP can now mark their post as a spoiler — this will add a tag to the post that clearly identifies it containing spoilers and pixilate the preview image if there is one.  Other users can then decide whether or not they want to view the post.

Spoiler tags are supported on the desktop site, mobile web and the official iOS and Android apps:

- [Spoiler post on desktop](https://i.redd.it/me0kodw5iiay.png) 
- [Spoiler post on mobile web](https://i.redd.it/q9rfsqg7iiay.png)

To see what spoilers look like in a safe, spoiler-free environment, we’ve created some sample spoiler posts in r/powerlanguagetest for you to peruse.

If you want full details about how to mark a post as a spoiler, or if you are a mod wondering about the implications for your community check out the [r/changelog post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) and the r/modnews post.

[Here's a rough schematic of what the code looks like without revealing any trade secrets or compromising the integrity of the algorithm.](https://i.redd.it/dastklohq01y.gif)  Many of these rules are still quite useful, but there are a few whose primary impact has been [to sometimes artificially deflate scores on the site](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/z1sfn/one_minute_obamas_ama_karma_score_was_16000_a/).  


Unfortunately, determining the impact of all of these rules is difficult without doing a drastic recompute of all the vote scores historically… so we did that!  Over the past few months, we have carefully recomputed historical votes on posts and comments to remove outdated, unnecessary rules. 


Very soon (think hours, not days), we’re going to cut the scores over to be reflective of these new and updated tallies.  A side effect of this is many of our seldom-recomputed listings (e.g., pretty much anything ending in /top) are going to initially display improper sorts. Please don’t panic. Those listings are computed via regular (scheduled) jobs, and as a result those pages will gradually come to reflect the new scoring over the course of the next four to six days.  We expect there to be some shifting of the top/all time queues.  New items will be added in the proper place in the listing, and old items will get reshuffled as the recomputes come in.  


To support the larger numbers that will result from this change, we’ll be updating the score display to switch to “k” when the score is over 10,000. Hopefully, this will not require you to further edit your subreddit CSS.

I ruined Thanksgiving. I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line—up to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x…) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics’. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.

We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, ""Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied."" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.

I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.

On Thursday, August 11, Reddit was down and unreachable across all platforms for about 1.5 hours, and slow to respond for an additional 1.5 hours. We apologize for the downtime and want to let you know steps we are taking to prevent it from happening again.

Thank you all for contributions to r/downtimebananas.

**Impact**

On Aug 11, Reddit was down from 15:24PDT to 16:52PDT, and was degraded from 16:52PDT to 18:19PDT. This affected all official Reddit platforms and the API serving third party applications. The downtime was due to an error during a migration of a critical backend system. 

No data was lost.

**Cause and Remedy**

We use a system called Zookeeper to keep track of most of our servers and their health. We also use an autoscaler system to maintain the required number of servers based on system load. 

Part of our infrastructure upgrades included migrating Zookeeper to a new, more modern, infrastructure inside the Amazon cloud. Since autoscaler reads from Zookeeper, we shut it off manually during the migration so it wouldn’t get confused about which servers should be available. It unexpectedly turned back on at 15:23PDT because our package management system noticed a manual change and reverted it. Autoscaler read the partially migrated Zookeeper data and terminated many of our application servers, which serve our website and API, and our caching servers, in 16 seconds.

At 15:24PDT, we noticed servers being shut down, and at 15:47PDT, we set the site to “down mode” while we restored the servers. By 16:42PDT, all servers were restored. However, at that point our new caches were still empty, leading to increased load on our databases, which in turn led to degraded performance. By 18:19PDT, latency returned to normal, and all systems were operating normally. 

**Prevention**

As we modernize our infrastructure, we may continue to perform different types of server migrations. Since this was due to a unique and risky migration that is now complete, we don’t expect this exact combination of failures to occur again. However, we have identified several improvements that will increase our overall tolerance to mistakes that can occur during risky migrations.

* Make our autoscaler less aggressive by putting limits to how many servers can be shut down at once.
* Improve our migration process by having two engineers pair during risky parts of migrations.
* Properly disable package management systems during migrations so they don’t affect systems unexpectedly.

**Last Thoughts**

We take downtime seriously, and are sorry for any inconvenience that we caused. The silver lining is that in the process of restoring our systems, we completed a big milestone in our operations modernization that will help make development a lot faster and easier at Reddit.",False,0.73,

As it relates to monetization, we’ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we’ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don’t want to compromise what’s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we’re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We’ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

We’ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we’ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We’ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.

4upf11,starfishjenga,New Ad Type: Promoted User Posts,1469549542.0,admin,1469577975.0,False,True,False,t3_4upf11,2191,False,0,"**TL;DR - [here is what this ad is](https://i.redd.it/dyib2c0odmbx.png)**

Hi all,
 
We’ve been working on some new ad products. When we’re thinking about new ad products, we want to ensure that what we’re creating is non-intrusive to you guys while remaining valuable to advertisers who are interested in participating in the community.
 
In conversations with many advertisers, we often hear that Redditors have already rallied around brands and products they genuinely like, and advertisers want to know how they can be part of that. But at the same time, we want to ensure that our communities remain free and user-controlled.
 
The solution, which we’re excited to share, is a new type of advertisement that we’re calling Promoted User Posts. This will essentially let an advertiser identify an organic post that they find especially relevant to their brand or product, and promote that in the Sponsored unit you guys are already used to. 

How it works:

* A redditor creates a post with brand-relevant content
* A brand notices the post and indicates to our sales team that they’re interested in promoting the post
* Our sales team reaches out to the author of the post to get explicit permission to use the post as part of a promoted user post
* If permission is given, a promoted user post is created by copying over the content and votes of the original post into a new promoted user post. (The comments will link to the same thread.)
* The original post will remain where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Note that no posts created by redditors will be used in this fashion without explicit opt-in approval from the redditor who created the post. Also - votes on the ad will not count towards karma or votes on the organic thread.**

For a screenshot of a hypothetical example, see [here](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png). (Note that Jenga is not a real advertiser at this time.)

Both of these changes will go live on Thursday, August 4. We’ll be speaking with mod teams ahead of time before any user promoted posts go live in their subreddits.

While we’re launching this new avenue for generating more Reddit revenue, we’ll also be shutting down a revenue generating experiment. Our experiment with [affiliate links](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) has ended for the time being. We’ve decided that focusing our energies on advertising is more congruent with our long term strategy.

Thanks for reading, and happy redditing!

Cheers,

u/starfishjenga

**FAQ**

**Q: I don’t want my content used as an advertisement, how do I avoid this?**
No content will be turned into a promoted post without the submitter’s explicit permission. If you don’t want this to happen, either don’t answer or say no when you’re asked.

**Q: What does the promoted by link point to?**
If a brand pays to promote a post, in the bottom right corner where it says ""promoted by"", the advertiser will be linked so that you will know who is promoting the post. Clicking on their name will link to an advertiser-determined location. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What if my content was originally intended to point somewhere else? Do advertisers have the right to change that? Wouldn’t this change the context of the pre-existing comments?**
Your content won’t be used in this way unless you agree to let it become a promoted user post.

If you’ve commented on a post that becomes a promoted user post, promoted user posts will simply create an additional link to these comments pages. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png).

**Q: What happens to the original votes? Is this a way for companies to juice the number of upvotes to their posts?**
The vote count from the original post will be copied to the promoted post, but any upvotes applied to the promoted post will not be copied back to the original post in order to preserve the integrity of the ranking algorithm.

**Q: What happens to the original post?**
The original post still remains where it was originally uploaded. The promoted user post comment section will link to the original comments section. See this example for details.

**Q: What does the link in the promoted post point to?**
Promoting a post does not change the destination of the original link. If it was a self post, it goes to the self post comments page. If it was a link post, it goes to the link destination, same as before. [Please see here for details on what points to where](https://i.redd.it/clxsmholmgax.png)

**Q: Is there a way for us to view where our content was promoted?**
If your content is chosen for promotion and you accept, we’ll give you a link to the promoted user post.

**Q: Do we get anything in return for agreeing to have our post promoted?**
This may vary across content and across time as we figure out what makes the most sense. It will generally take the form of Gold membership for some amount of time.

**Q: Won’t this encourage more users to submit content containing brands (and more fuss from /r/HailCorporate over “shilling”)?**
We don’t believe the rewards on offer are enough to change people’s behavior in this case, but we’ll keep an eye on it and deal with any problems that arise.

EDIT 3: I believe some redditors may be confusing this announcement with a different one for [in-feed ad tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) which we announced prior to this.",False,0.4,

On Reddit we call these points Karma.  You get Karma when content you post to Reddit receives upvotes.  Your Karma is displayed on [your userpage](http://reddit.com/u/me).

You may also know that you can submit different types of posts to Reddit.  One of these post types is a text-post (e.g. this thing you’re reading right now is a text-post).  Due to [various shenanigans and low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6p5ef/sorry_karmawhores_no_more_karma_for_selfposts/) we stopped giving Karma for text-posts over 8 years ago.

However, over time the usage of text-posts has matured and they are now used to create some of the most iconic and interesting original content on Reddit.  Who could forget such classics as:

- [Jar Jar Binks was a trained Force user, knowing Sith collaborator, and will play a central role in The Force Awakens](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/3qvj6w/theory_jar_jar_binks_was_a_trained_force_user/) - from r/starwars 
- [What tasty food would be disgusting if eaten over rice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/) - from r/askreddit 
- [You people make me sick [a grilled cheese meltdown]](https://np.reddit.com/r/grilledcheese/comments/2or1p3/you_people_make_me_sick/) - from r/grilledcheese 

Text-posts make up over 65% of submissions to Reddit and some of our best subreddits only accept text-posts. Because of this Reddit has become known for thought-provoking, witty, and in-depth text-posts, and their success has played a large role in the popularity Reddit currently enjoys.

To acknowledge this, from this day forward we will now be giving users karma for text-posts. This will be combined with link karma and presented as ‘post karma’ on [userpages](http://reddit.com/u/me).

TL:DR; We used to not give you karma for your text-posts.  We do now.  Sweet.

We’re going to be launching a test on Monday, June 27 to get a better understanding of the costs and benefits of putting sponsored headlines inside the content feed vs. at the top. We believe that this will help Reddit move closer to becoming a long-term sustainable business with an average small to zero negative impact to the user experience.

Specifically, users who are (randomly) selected to be part of the test group will see a redesigned version of the sponsored headline moving between positions 1-6 in the content feed on desktop. You can see examples of a couple design variants [here](http://i.imgur.com/W2zUlcS.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/GppJVkh.jpg) (we may introduce new test variants as we gather more data). We tried to strike a balance with ads that are clearly labeled but not too loud or obnoxious.

We will be monitoring a couple of things. Do we see higher ad engagement when the ads are not pinned to the top of the page? Do we see higher content engagement when the top link is not an ad?

As usual, feedback on this change is welcome. I’ll be reading your comments and will respond to as many as I can.

Thanks for reading!

**EDIT 1:** Hide functionality will still be available for these new formats. The reason it doesn't show up in the screenshots is because those were taken in a logged out state. Sorry for the confusion!

A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.

Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.

The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/all—our specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simple—as a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.

Many people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the years—ones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. 

Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. That’s Reddit for you. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Reddit—let’s remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, let’s all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let’s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.

I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.

The story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.

Whether you agree with r/news’ policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.

We are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We–Reddit Inc, moderators, and users–all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.

In the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:

* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.
* [We’re introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): They’ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.
* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.
* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.

Again, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We’ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time. ",False,0.52,

Today we’re launching a test to rewrite links (in both comments and posts) to automatically include an affiliate URL crediting Reddit with the referral to approximately five thousand merchants (Amazon won’t be included). This will only happen in cases where an existing affiliate link is not already in place. Only a small percentage of users will experience this during the test phase, and all affected redditors will be able to opt out via a setting in user preferences labelled “replace all affiliate links”.

The redirect will be inserted by JavaScript when the user clicks the link. The link displayed on hover will match the original link. Clicking will forward users through a third-party service called Viglink which will be responsible for rewriting the URL to its final destination. We’ve signed a contract with them that explicitly states they won't store user data or cookies during this process.

We’re structuring this as a test so we can better evaluate the opportunity. There are a variety of ways we can improve this feature, but we want to learn if it’s worth our time. It’s important that Reddit become a sustainable business so that we may continue to exist. To that end, we will explore a variety of monetization opportunities. Not everything will work, and we appreciate your understanding while we experiment.

Thanks for your support.

Some FAQs:

**Will this work with my adblocker?**
Yes, we specifically tested for this case and it should work fine.

**Are the outgoing links HTTPS?**
Yes.

**Why are you using a third party instead of just implementing it yourselves?**
Integrating five thousand merchants across multiple countries is non-trivial. Using Viglink allowed us to integrate a much larger number of merchants than we would have been able to do ourselves.

**Can I switch this off for my subreddit?**
Not right now, but we will be discussing this with subreddit mods who are significantly affected before a wider rollout.

**Will this change be reflected in the site FAQ?**
~~Yes, this will be completed shortly.~~ This is available [here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/202082046-Affiliate-links)

**EDIT (additional FAQ): Will the opt out be for links I post, or links I view?** When you opt out, neither content you post nor content you view will be affiliatized.

**EDIT (additional FAQ 2): What will this look like in practice?** If I post a link to [a storm trooper necklace](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Star-Wars-Storm-Trooper-3D-Necklace/111817866493?_trksid=p2047675.c100009.m1982&_trkparms=aid%3D777000%26algo%3DABA.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20131227121020%26meid%3Daa3df26a727e4999b28c34077939ff19%26pid%3D100009%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26sd%3D112015566756) and don't opt out or include an affiliate link then when you click this link, it will be rewritten so that you're redirected through Viglink and Reddit gets an affiliate credit for any purchase made.

**EDIT 3** We've added some questions about this feature to the [FAQ](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/202082046-Affiliate-links)

**EDIT 4** For those asking about the ability to opt out - based on your feedback we'll make the opt out available to everyone (not just those in the test group), so that if the feature rolls out more widely then you'll already be opted out *provided you have changed the user setting*. This will go live later today.

**EDIT 5** The user preference has been added for *all* users. If you do not want to participate, go ahead and uncheck the box in your user preferences labeled ""replace affiliate links"" and content you create or view will not have affiliate links added.

With this access to likely username and password combinations, we've noticed a general uptick in account takeovers (ATOs) by malicious (or at best spammy) third parties.  

Though Reddit itself has not been exploited, even the best security in the world won't work when users are *reusing passwords between sites*.  We've ramped up our ability to detect the takeovers, and sent out 100k password resets in the last 2 weeks.  More are to come as we continue to verify and validate that no one except for you is using your account.  But, to make everyone's life easier and to help ensure that the next time you log in you aren't greeted a request to reset your password:

 * Choose a [strong, **unique** password](https://xkcd.com/936/).  The emphasis here is important.  I don't mean ""use that really good password you use on sites you care about.""  I mean [""one that is used for Reddit and Reddit alone!""](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/)   [Password reuse is really bad!](https://xkcd.com/792/)  We care a lot about security, but we can't do anything about the security of that *other* site you use the same password on who decides not to use [bcrypt](https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/) but rather a [nifty hashing scheme of their own devising!](https://blog.codinghorror.com/speed-hashing/)
 * [Set and verify an email address](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/).  We currently have exactly one way for you to reset your account and that's by email.  For almost 11 years we've been respectful of your not wanting to necessarily give us an email address.  If your account gets taken over and you've got no reset email, you're going to have a bad time.
 * [Check your own account activity page!](https://www.reddit.com/account-activity)  If you see some IPs in there that you don't recognize (and especially ones from countries you don't spend much time in), it's probably not a bad idea to [change your password](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/update/).  This might break any integrations you have with 3rd parties you've shared your credentials with, but it's easy to re-auth.

On a related point, a quick note about throw-aways: throw-away accounts are fine, but we have tons of completely abandoned accounts with no discernible history and exist as placeholders in our database. They've never posted. They've never voted.  They haven't logged in *for several years*.   They are also a huge possible surface area for ATOs, because I generally don't want to think about (though I do) how many of them have the password ""hunter2"". Shortly, we're going to start issuing password resets to these accounts and, if we don't get a reaction in about a month, we're going to disable them. Please keep an eye out!

**Q**: *Jeez, guys why don't you enable two-factor authentication (2FA) already?*

**A**: We're definitely considering it.  In fact, admins are required to have 2FA set up to use the administrative parts of the site.  It's behind a second authentication layer to make sure that if *we* get hacked, the most that an attacker can do is post something smug and self serving with a little [A] after it, which...well nevermind.  

Unfortunately, to roll this out further, reddit has a [huge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewshu.android.reddit&hl=en) [ecosystem](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8) [of](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onelouder.baconreader&hl=en) [apps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/narwhal-for-reddit/id845422455?mt=8), including our newly released [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) clients, to say nothing of integrations like with ifttt.com and that script you wrote as a school project that you forgot to shut off.  ""Adding 2FA to the login flow"" will require a lot of coordination.

**Q**: *Sure.  First you come to delete inactive accounts, then it'll be...!*

**A**: Please. Stop.  We're not talking about removing content, and so we're certainly not going to be removing users that have a history.  If ATOs are a brush fire, abandoned, unused accounts are dry kindling.  Besides, we all know [who the enemy is](/user/me) and [why!](http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/200/)

AMA!

### Hi everyone!

I’m Alex–I joined Reddit five months ago as the VP of Consumer Product and I’m excited to introduce myself and bring you some good news today.

### Who are you?

I work with our product managers and designers to figure out what things we should build. I also work with u/mart2d2 and our engineering teams to figure out how we should build them. I’ve been a Redditor for eight years and it’s a huge privilege for me to work on improving Reddit as my day job. 

In my spare time, I focus on raising my kid (shoutout to r/daddit), I play Super Smash Bros. Melee poorly (Falco 4 life), and I love listening to podcasts (RadioLab, 99PI, Imaginary Worlds).

### What’s New?

When I arrived in November, I inherited a lot of plans—there are a lot of things to get done at Reddit! We’ve made progress on many fronts since I’ve joined, but there are two items on that original list that we’ve been working on for a long time:

1. Deliver our first official Android Reddit App. 
2. Improve and stabilize Alien Blue.

Building our first Android Reddit app is a no-brainer for us. Many core Redditors are Android users and it is important for us to deliver an official app experience that makes us proud.

Revamping Alien Blue is also a pretty obvious thing to do, but what started out as a simple improvement project turned into a much larger effort. We’ve decided to rebuild our iPhone app from the ground up to be faster, more modern, and more usable. We’re proud to share with you what we think is be the best way to experience Reddit on iPhone

So here it is: introducing [Reddit for iPhone](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=121809) and [Reddit for Android](https://294177.measurementapi.com/serve?action=click&publisher_id=294177&site_id=122129), featuring inline images, night theme, compact and card views, and simpler navigation. Please take a moment to head over to the app stores and check out what we’ve built for you.

### What’s Next

This is the beginning of our journey with you, our app users. For everyone joining us on this ride, you can expect a lot of updates and new features that we’ll be rolling out to mobile first. Our first feature releases are getting prepared now and we’ll be updating at least once a month. Of course, if you already have an app you like, you're free to continue enjoying it. We will continue to support our free public api.

Please give our new apps a spin and post love notes, feature requests, roasts, etc., to this thread. We’d love to hear what you think and will be incorporating feedback. I will personally read each top comment (using the Speed Read button in our iPhone app!).

I’ll be hanging out in the comments for a couple of hours to answer any questions you have about our apps and Reddit in general. AMA!

Thanks!  
Alex

**Noon PT Edit:** Thanks for your questions and warm welcome everyone! I'm going to take a quick break to check in on our Android team – we're going to submit a hotfix for Android 4.4 crashes and back button issues. That should be in your hands before EOD. I'll be back to answer more Qs and read the rest of the comments in a few hours.

This leads to great communities and deep meaningful discussions.  But, sometimes this very openness can lead to less awesome stuff like spam, trolling, and worse, harassment.  We work hard to deal with these when they occur publicly.  Today, we’re happy to announce that we’ve just released a feature to help you filter them from within your own inbox: user blocking.

Believe it or not, we’ve actually had a [""block user"" feature](http://i.imgur.com/Tszb0YJ.png) in a basic form for [quite a while](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/4d7a2fa4e0f01f7010e0f7fd0317cb783cda54c1), though over time its utility focused to apply to only private messages.  [We’ve recently updated](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/6c9a28e6bd0cebc05e220b6d807b4bf46663474b) its behavior to apply more broadly: you can now block users that reply to you in comment replies as well.  Simply click the “Block User” button while viewing the reply in your inbox. From that point on, the profile of the blocked user, along with all their comments, posts, and messages, will then be completely removed from your view.  You will no longer be alerted if they message you further.  As before, the block is [completely silent to the blocked user](http://i.imgur.com/GUIBD9t.png).  Blocks can be viewed or removed on [your preferences page here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/blocked/).

Our changes to user blocking are intended to let you decide what your boundaries are, and to give you the option to *choose* what you want—or don’t want—to be exposed to. [And, of course, you can and should still always *report* harassment to our community team!]

These are just our first steps toward improving the experience of using Reddit, and we’re looking forward to announcing many more.",False,0.78,

We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, we’ve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). 

We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.

Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isn’t easy as a small company as we don’t always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.

In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.

In 2016, we’ve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief [supporting Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf), detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.

In addition, we joined an amicus brief [supporting Apple](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf) in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to [vacate the court order](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html) compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. 

We are also excited to announce the launch of our [external law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines). Beyond clarifying how Reddit works as a platform and briefly outlining how both federal and state law enforcements can compel Reddit to turn over user information, we believe they make very clear that we adhere to strict standards. 

We know the success of Reddit is made possible by your trust. We hope this transparency report strengthens that trust, and is a signal to you that we care deeply about your privacy.

(I'll do my best to answer questions, but as with all legal matters, I can't always be completely candid.)

edit: I'm off for now. There are a few questions that I'll try to answer after I get clarification.

On Reddit, a media preview is an image, video, or gallery in a **link post** that can be expanded with a button and viewed directly on listings and comments pages without having to leave Reddit.  Right now, we have media previews for certain types of videos, image galleries and sound files.  Media previews are controlled by [buttons that look like this](http://i.imgur.com/epKvK2w.png).

#That’s wonderful, but what have you actually changed?

**Auto-Expanded Media Previews on Comment Pages**

By default if there is a preview for a link, we will expand it on comments pages and show the comments below.  [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/ql0DK3C.png).  Since the discussion generally revolves around the media content, auto-expanding will save many users a click.

**New Media Preferences**

You can control how media previews display on your screen with [new preferences](http://i.imgur.com/706GVIR.png) available on your [preferences page](http://reddit.com/prefs).  

**Media previews support more file types**

We’ve updated media previews to show content from more file types, most notably direct image links.  Put simply, if you submit a link post to to Reddit with a URL that ends in `.jpg`, `.png`, etc., that media will be expandable.  Put even simply-er, more content on Reddit will have a preview available.

**NSFW Flows**

Since media previews are expanded by default on comments pages, we’ve also added an[ optional screen to block NSFW media](http://i.imgur.com/bdCCAat.gifv). This will let you more quickly choose whether or not to see NSFW media.

**TL;DR:**

Now that 2015 is in the books, it’s a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddit’s mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddit’s communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is ""Look Forward."" Reddit has a long history, and it’s important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but it’s shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.

Thank you for reading. I’ll be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

3sbrro,powerlanguage,Account suspensions: A transparent alternative to shadowbans,1447191610.0,admin,1447193635.0,False,True,False,t3_3sbrro,3752,False,18176,"Today we’re rolling out a new type of account restriction called suspensions.  Suspensions will replace [shadowbans](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ey0fv/on_shadowbans/) for the vast majority of real humans and increase transparency when handling users who violate [Reddit’s content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).

## How it works

* Suspensions can only be applied to accounts by the Reddit admins (not moderators).
* Suspended accounts will always receive a notification about the suspension including reason and the duration:
    * [See example notification PM](http://i.imgur.com/wQJrnGR.png) - Sent to user account from r/reddit.com 
    * [See example on-page notification](http://i.imgur.com/yzzSXEU.png) - Shown on pages while an account is suspended 
* Suspended users can reply to the notification PM to appeal their suspension 
* Suspensions can be temporary or permanent, depending on the severity of infraction and the user’s previous infractions. 

## What it does to an account

Suspended users effectively have their account put into read-only mode.  The primary actions they will not be able to perform are:

- Voting 
- Submitting posts 
- Commenting 
- Sending private messages 
  
Moderators who have been suspended will not be able to perform any mod actions or access modmail while the suspension is in effect.

You can see [the full list of forbidden actions for suspended users here](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205687686).

Users in both temporary and permanent suspensions will always be able to delete/edit their posts and comments as usual.

Users browsing on a desktop version of the site will see a [pop-up notice](http://i.imgur.com/4uBMcu2.png) or [notification page](http://i.imgur.com/eyvYgt5.png) anytime they try and perform an action they are forbidden from doing.  App users will receive an error depending on how each app developer chooses to indicate the status of suspended accounts.

## User pages

* Visiting the user page of an account that has been permanently suspended will [indicate that the account has been suspended](http://i.imgur.com/eXIlh9i.png) and will not display any other data.
* Visiting the user page of an account that has been temporarily suspended will not give any indication that the account is currently suspended.
* In addition to this, we have also updated user pages for deleted accounts to clearly [display that the account in question was deleted by the user](http://i.imgur.com/bfTfhxs.png). 

## Why this is a good thing

Our current form of account restriction, [the shadowban](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3ey0fv/on_shadowbans/), is great for dealing with bots/spam rings but woefully inadequate for real human beings.  We think suspensions are a vast improvement.

* Suspensions inform people when they’ve broken the rules.  While this seems like a no-brainer, this helps so we can identify the specific behavior that caused the suspension.
* Users are given a chance to correct their behavior.  We’re all human and we all make mistakes.  Reddit believes in the goodness of people.  We think most people won’t intentionally continue to violate a rule after being notified.
* Suspensions can vary in length depending on the severity of the infraction and user’s history.  This allows flexibility when applying suspensions. Different types of infraction can have different responses.
* Increased transparency.  We want to be upfront about suspending user accounts to both the user being suspended and other users (where appropriate).

* Yes, Zach Weiner (/u/MrWeiner) is one my brothers.  I believe he’d agree that I am the superior sibling in that my name comes earlier in the alphabet.
* Q4 planning at Reddit is underway.  Engineering will likely be focusing on 7 key areas, with the theme of getting engineering onto a solid foundation:
    - Hiring strong engineers like mad
    - Reducing stress on the team by prioritizing work that reduces chances of downtime and false alarms
    - Building some much needed moderator and community tools (currently working to prioritize which ones)
    - Performing a major overhaul of our age old code base and architecture so that we can create new product faster, better, and more enjoyably
    - Shipping killer iOS and Android apps
    - Continue building a badass data pipeline and data science platform
    - Improving our ads system significantly (improving auction model, targeting, and billing)

These goals will likely take all of Q4 and quite possibly all of Q1, especially the overhaul.  Code cleanups of this size take a *long* time to reach 100% done (in my experience), but we do hope to get to “escape velocity” — meaning that the code is in a much better place that allows us to move faster building new products/tools and onboarding new engineers, while doing incremental cleanup forevermore.

Keep the PMs coming!  Been getting awesome feedback (positive and negative) and super strong resumes.  The super duper highest priority hiring needs are iOS / Android, Infra / Ops, Data Eng, and Full Stack.  Everything else is merely ""super highest priority"".

Finally, yes, it’s true.  I am running for President of the United States.  My platform will focus on more video games and less cilantro.

I love studying the relationship between our limbic and rational selves, how communication breaks down, what motivates people / teams, and how to build amazing cultures.  I’m currently learning everything I can about what constitutes a strong company culture and trying to make the discussion of culture more rigorous than it currently is in the valley.

Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit.

I want to first address the effect my resignation will have on the community. A large part of my role as Head of Community was reflected behind the scenes (policy, community regulation etc.) and the community team is much more interactive than I on a daily basis so very little will change after my departure.

Media outlets are suggesting that the circumstances around my departure are different than they are in reality so I'd like to clear this up as I don't like being misrepresented. Since a few women have left reddit recently, certain reports have implied that my gender was the cause. That is simply not the case as I have always felt respected as a colleague here and managed to surround myself with good people in an industry not always known for that. The theory that I am leaving because of recent changes in policy is also false as I happily participated in creating those changes and stand by the decision to enforce them.

At the expense of boring you with the truth, I have made this decision to resign so that I can head home to spend time with my family. The last few years have been pretty crazy and honestly, I'm looking forward to a Christmas free of work - but still encourage you all to continue to make the [reddit gift exchange](https://www.redditgifts.com/) a ground breaking experience!!! It really is that simple. It was not an easy decision to make but I know it's the right one for me right now. 

So what's next? Obviously, we need someone to take on this role in my absence and it's crucial to the well-being of reddit to have a qualified person in this seat. We should have someone who knows the community inside and out, who understands the policies and practices, and who has been using the tools long enough to know what works and needs work. reddit is entirely unique and deserves to be run by people who truly understand it.

Lucky for us, we had the perfect candidate sitting right in front of us! When /u/spez asked if I had anyone in mind, there was only one person I thought of, /u/krispykrackers. Her amazing knowledge of the history of reddit, how the community works, and the cultures of individual subreddits is exactly what we need from a Head of Community. A redditor since 2008, employed by reddit for five years, and a community manager for over a year, she has been a very important part of our daily community interactions and is so dedicated to her work that I'm not sure she even sleeps!

I'm very confident that krispy and spez, along with the rest of reddit, will guide the community to the best state it has ever been in and I am excited to see the future of reddit unfold with their leadership. 
Join me in welcoming krispykrackers to her new and much deserved role of Head of Community at reddit!

It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

3djjxw,spez,Let's talk content. AMA.,1437076815.0,admin,1437084911.0,False,True,False,t3_3djjxw,21505,False,14108,"We started Reddit to be—as we said back then with our tongues in our cheeks—“The front page of the Internet.” Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: “because I don’t want that content on our site.”

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didn’t have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason we’re careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Reddit—or at least say on our public pages—in the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someone’s private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they don’t pollute people’s enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditor’s listings, and we think it’ll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We’ve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don’t want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it’s more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. I’d appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.""

There has been a lot of discussion lately —on reddit, in the news, and here internally— about reddit’s policy on the more offensive and obscene content on our platform. Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.

The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don’t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.

Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It’s something we’ve been thinking about for quite some time.  We haven’t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we’re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.

We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I’ll be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.

3cucye,samaltman,An old team at reddit,1436562890.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_3cucye,20306,False,132253,"Ellen Pao resigned from reddit today by mutual agreement.  I'm delighted to announce that Steve Huffman, founder and the original reddit CEO, is returning as CEO.
 
We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to reddit and the technology industry generally.  She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.  She brought a face to reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry.  She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015.  I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.
 
We’re very happy to have Steve back.  Product and community are the two legs of reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.  He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of reddit history in his head.  Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of “cofounder”.
 
A few other points.  Mods, you are what makes reddit great.  The reddit team, now with Steve, wants to do more for you.  You deserve better moderation tools and better communication from the admins.
 
Second, redditors, you deserve clarity about what the content policy of reddit is going to be.  The team will create guidelines to both preserve the integrity of reddit and to maintain reddit as the place where the most open and honest conversations with the entire world can happen.

Third, as a redditor, I’m particularly happy that Steve is so passionate about mobile.  I’m very excited to use reddit more on my phone.
 
As a closing note, it was sickening to see some of the things redditors wrote about Ellen. [1] The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world.  People are still people even if there is Internet between you.

If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.  Steve’s great challenge as CEO [2] will be continuing the work Ellen started to drive this forward.
 
 
[1] Disagreements are fine.  Death threats are not, are not covered under free speech, and will continue to get offending users banned.

Ellen asked me to point out that the sweeping majority of redditors didn’t do this, and many were incredibly supportive. Although the incredible power of the Internet is the amplification of voices, unfortunately sometimes those voices are hateful.
 
[2] We were planning to run a CEO search here and talked about how Steve (who we assumed was unavailable) was the benchmark candidate—he has exactly the combination of talent and vision we were looking for.  To our delight, it turned out our hypothetical benchmark candidate is the one actually taking the job.

We have apologized and made promises to you, the moderators and the community, over many years, but time and again, we haven’t delivered on them. When you’ve had feedback or requests, we haven’t always been responsive. The mods and the community have lost trust in me and in us, the administrators of reddit.

Today, we acknowledge this long history of mistakes. We are grateful for all you do for reddit, and the buck stops with me. We are taking three concrete steps:

**Tools**: We will improve tools, not just promise improvements, building on work already underway.  u/deimorz and u/weffey will be working as a team with the moderators on what tools to build and then delivering them.

**Communication**: u/krispykrackers is trying out the new role of Moderator Advocate. She will be the contact for moderators with reddit and will help figure out the best way to talk more often. We’re also going to figure out the best way for more administrators, including myself, to talk more often with the whole community.

**Search**: We are providing an option for moderators to default to the old version of search to support your existing moderation workflows. Instructions for setting this default are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/search#wiki_enabling_legacy_search).

Our goal is to enable as many people as possible to have authentic conversations and share ideas and content on an open platform. We want as little involvement as possible in managing these interactions but will be involved when needed to protect privacy and free expression, and to prevent harassment.

It is not easy to balance these values, especially as the Internet evolves. We are learning and hopefully improving as we move forward. We want to be open about our involvement:
We will ban subreddits that allow their communities to use the subreddit as a platform to [harass](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) individuals when moderators don’t take action. We’re banning behavior, not ideas.

Today we are removing five subreddits that break our reddit rules based on their harassment of individuals. If a subreddit has been banned for harassment, you will see that in the ban notice. The only banned subreddit with more than 5,000 subscribers is r/fatpeoplehate.

To report a subreddit for harassment, please email us at contact@reddit.com or [send a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com).

We are continuing to add to our team to manage community issues, and we are making incremental changes over time. We want to make sure that the changes are working as intended and that we are incorporating your feedback when possible. Ultimately, we hope to have less involvement, but right now, we know we need to do better and to do more. 

While we do not always agree with the content and views expressed on the site, we do protect the right of people to express their views and encourage actual conversations according to the [rules of reddit](https://www.reddit.com/rules/).

In an effort to continue moving forward, we are changing how we respond to legal takedowns. In 2014, the vast majority of the [content reddit removed was for copyright and trademark reasons](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014#wiki_requests_for_removal_of_user_information), and 2015 is shaping up to be no different.

Previously, when we removed content, we had to remove **everything**: link or self text, comments, all of it. When that happened, you might have come across a comments page that had nothing more than [this, surprised and censored Snoo](http://i.imgur.com/FSXEP66.png).

There would be no reason, no information, just a surprised, censored Snoo. Not even a ""discuss this on reddit,"" which is rather un-reddit-like.

Today, this changes. 

**Effective immediately,** we're replacing the use of censored Snoo and moving to an approach that lets us preserve content that hasn't specifically been legally removed (like comment threads), and clearly identifies that we, as reddit, INC, removed the content in question.

Let us pretend we have this post I made on reddit, suspiciously titled ""Test post, please ignore"", as seen [in its original state here](http://i.imgur.com/Fn5cQFu.png), featuring one of my cats. Additionally, there is a comment on that post which is the first paragraph of this post.

Should we receive a [valid DMCA request](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement#section_dmca) for this content and deem it legally actionable, rather than being greeted with censored Snoo and no other relevant information, visitors to the post instead will now see [a message stating that we, as admins of reddit.com, removed the content and a brief reason why](http://i.imgur.com/gcwz5ks.png). 

A more detailed, although still abridged, version of the notice will be posted to /r/ChillingEffects, and a sister post submitted to chillingeffects.org.

You can view an example of a removed post and comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillingEffects/comments/35urvq/test_post_please_ignore/).

We’re especially excited about building more mod tools to let software do the hard stuff when it comes to moderating your particular community. We’re striving to build the robots that will give you more time to spend engaging with your community -- [spend more time discussing the virtues of cooking with spam](http://redd.it/2mc9tt), not dealing with spam in your subreddit.



**Protecting Your Digital Privacy**

Last year, we missed a chance to be a leader in social media when it comes to protecting your privacy -- something we’ve cared deeply about since reddit’s inception. At our recent all hands company meeting, this was something that we all, as a company, decided we needed to address.

No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit. We also recognize that violent personalized images are a form of harassment that we do not tolerate and we will remove them when notified. [As usual, the revised Privacy Policy will go into effect in two weeks, on March 10, 2015](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy#section_involuntary_pornography).

[We’re so proud to be leading the way among our peers when it comes to your digital privacy and consider this to be one more step in the right direction.](http://redd.it/2sk8i9) We’ll share how often these takedowns occur in our yearly privacy report.

We made reddit to be the world’s best platform for communities to be informed about whatever interests them. We’re learning together as we go, and today’s changes are going to help grow reddit for the next ten years and beyond.

We’re so grateful and excited to have you join us on this journey.

2sk8i9,ekjp,We're updating the reddit Privacy Policy and User Agreement and we want your feedback - Ask Us Anything!,1421359543.0,admin,1421436357.0,False,True,False,t3_2sk8i9,1849,False,2899,"As CEO of reddit, I want to let you know about some changes to our Privacy Policy and User Agreement, and about some internal changes designed to continue protecting your privacy as we grow.

We regularly review our internal practices and policies to make sure that our commitment to your privacy is reflected across reddit. This year, to make sure we continue to focus on privacy as we grow as a company, we have created a cross-functional privacy group.  This group is responsible for advocating the privacy of our users as a company-wide priority and for reviewing any decision that impacts user privacy.  We created this group to ensure that, as we grow as a company, we continue to preserve privacy rights across the board and to protect your privacy.  

One of the first challenges for this group was how we manage and use data via our official mobile apps, since mobile platforms and advertising work differently than on the web.  Today we are publishing a new reddit [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) that reflects these changes, as well as other updates on how and when we use and protect your data.  This revised policy is intended to be a clear and direct description of how we manage your data and the steps we take to ensure your privacy on reddit. We’ve also updated areas of our [User Agreement](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement) related to DMCA and trademark policies.

We believe most of our mobile users are more willing to share information to have better experiences.  We are experimenting with some ad partners to see if we can provide better advertising experiences in our mobile apps. We [let you know](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/24aevu/we_like_you_all_so_we_wanted_to_let_you_know/) before we launched mobile that we will be collecting some additional mobile-related data that is not available from the website to help improve your experience. We now have more specifics to share. We have included a separate section on accessing reddit from mobile to make clear what data is collected by the devices and to show you how you can opt out of mobile advertising tracking on our official mobile apps. We also want to make clear that our practices for those accessing reddit on the web have not changed significantly as you can see in [this document](https://www.redditstatic.com/policy-changes/privacypolicy-2015-01-15.html) highlighting the Privacy Policy changes, and [this document](https://www.redditstatic.com/policy-changes/useragreement-2015-01-15.html) highlighting the User Agreement changes.

Transparency about our privacy practices and policy is an important part of our values. In the next two weeks, we also plan to publish a transparency report to let you know when we disclosed or removed user information in response to external requests in 2014.  This report covers government information requests for user information and copyright removal requests, and it summarizes how we responded.

We plan to publish a transparency report annually and to update our Privacy Policy before changes are made to keep people up to date on our practices and how we treat your data.  We will never change our policies in a way that affects your rights without giving you time to read the policy and give us feedback. 

The revised Privacy Policy will go into effect on January 29, 2015. We want to give you time to ask questions, provide feedback and to review the revised Privacy Policy before it goes into effect.
As with previous privacy policy changes, we have enlisted the help of Lauren Gelman (/u/LaurenGelman) and Matt Cagle (/u/mcbrnao) of BlurryEdge Strategies. Lauren, Matt, myself and other reddit employees will be answering questions today in this thread about the revised policy. Please share questions, concerns and feedback - AUA (Ask Us Anything).

**The following is a brief summary (TL;DR) of the changes to the Privacy Policy and User Agreement. We strongly encourage that you read the documents in full.**

* Clarify that across all products including advertising, except for the IP address you use to create the account, all IP addresses will be deleted from our servers after 90 days.
* Clarify we work with Stripe and Paypal to process reddit gold transactions.
* We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances.
* We use pixel data to collect information about how users use reddit for internal analytics.  
* Clarify that we limit employee access to user data.
* We beefed up the section of our User Agreement on intellectual property, the DMCA and takedowns to clarify how we notify users of requests, how they can counter-notice, and that we have a repeat infringer policy.

2fpdax,alienth,Time to talk,1410076177.0,admin,1410093090.0,False,True,False,t3_2fpdax,8800,False,14401,"Alright folks, [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2foivo/every_man_is_responsible_for_his_own_soul/) has pretty obviously devolved and we're not getting anywhere. The blame for that definitely lies with us. We're trying to explain some of what has been going on here, but the simultaneous banning of that set of subreddits entangled in this situation has hurt our ability to have that conversation with you, the community. A lot of people are saying what we're doing here reeks of bullshit, and I don't blame them.


I'm not going to ask that you agree with me, but I hope that reading this will give you a better understanding of the decisions we've been poring over constantly over the past week, and perhaps give the community some deeper insight and understanding of what is happening here. I would ask, but obviously not require, that you read this fully and carefully before responding or voting on it. I'm going to give you the very raw breakdown of what has been going on at reddit, and it is likely to be coloured by my own personal opinions. All of us working on this over the past week are fucking exhausted, including myself, so you'll have to forgive me if this seems overly dour.


Also, as an aside, my main job at reddit is systems administration. I take care of the servers that run the site. It isn't my job to interact with the community, but I try to do what I can. I'm certainly not the best communicator, so please feel free to ask for clarification on anything that might be unclear.


With that said, here is what has been happening at reddit, inc over the past week.


A very shitty thing happened this past Sunday. A number of very private and personal photos were stolen and spread across the internet. The fact that these photos belonged to celebrities increased the interest in them by orders of magnitude, but that in no way means they were any less harmful or deplorable. If the same thing had happened to anyone you hold dear, it'd make you sick to your stomach with grief and anger.


When the photos went out, they inevitably got linked to on reddit. As more people became aware of them, we started getting a huge amount of traffic, which broke the site in several ways.


That same afternoon, we held an internal emergency meeting to figure out what we were going to do about this situation. Things were going pretty crazy in the moment, with many folks out for the weekend, and the site struggling to stay afloat. We had some immediate issues we had to address. First, the amount of traffic hitting this content was breaking the site in various ways. Second, we were already getting DMCA and takedown notices by the owners of these photos. Third, if we were to remove anything on the site, whether it be for technical, legal, or ethical obligations, it would likely result in a backlash where things kept getting posted over and over again, thwarting our efforts and possibly making the situation worse.


The decisions which we made amidst the chaos on Sunday afternoon were the following: I would do what I could, including disabling functionality on the site, to keep things running (this was a pretty obvious one). We would handle the DMCA requests as they came in, and recommend that the rights holders contact the company hosting these images so that they could be removed. We would also continue to monitor the site to see where the activity was unfolding, especially in regards to /r/all (we didn't want /r/all to be primarily covered with links to stolen nudes, deal with it). I'm not saying all of these decisions were correct, or morally defensible, but it's what we did based on our best judgement in the moment, and our experience with similar incidents in the past.


In the following hours, a lot happened. I had to break /r/thefappening a few times to keep the site from completely falling over, which as expected resulted in an immediate creation of a new slew of subreddits. Articles in the press were flying out and we were getting comment requests left and right. Many community members were understandably angered at our lack of action or response, and made that known in various ways. 

Later that day we were alerted that some of these photos depicted minors, which is where we have drawn a clear line in the sand. In response we immediately started removing things on reddit which we found to be linking to those pictures, and also recommended that the image hosts be contacted so they could be removed more permanently. We do not allow links on reddit to child pornography or images which sexualize children. If you disagree with that stance, and believe reddit cannot draw that line while also being a platform, I'd encourage you to leave.

This nightmare of the weekend made myself and many of my coworkers feel pretty awful. I had an obvious responsibility to keep the site up and running, but seeing that all of my efforts were due to a huge number of people scrambling to look at stolen private photos didn't sit well with me personally, to say the least. We hit new traffic milestones, ones which I'd be ashamed to share publicly. Our general stance on this stuff is that reddit is a platform, and there are times when platforms get used for very deplorable things. We take down things we're legally required to take down, and do our best to keep the site getting from spammed or manipulated, and beyond that we *try* to keep our hands off. Still, in the moment, seeing what we were seeing happen, it was hard to see much merit to that viewpoint.


As the week went on, press stories went out and debate flared everywhere. A lot of focus was obviously put on us, since reddit was clearly one of the major places people were using to find these photos. We continued to receive DMCA takedowns as these images were constantly rehosted and linked to on reddit, and in response we continued to remove what we were legally obligated to, and beyond that instructed the rights holders on how to contact image hosts. 

Meanwhile, we were having a huge amount of debate internally at reddit, inc. A lot of members on our team could not understand what we were doing here, why we were continuing to allow ourselves to be party to this flagrant violation of privacy, why we hadn't made a statement regarding what was going on, and how on earth we got to this point. It was messy, and continues to be. The pseudo-result of all of this debate and argument has been that we should continue to be as open as a platform as we can be, and that while we in no way condone or agree with this activity, we should not intervene beyond what the law requires. The arguments for and against are numerous, and this is not a comfortable stance to take in this situation, but it is what we have decided on.



That brings us to today. After painfully arriving at a stance internally, we felt it necessary to make a statement on the reddit blog. We could have let this die down in silence, as it was already tending to do, but we felt it was critical that we have this conversation with our community. If you haven't read it yet, **[please do so](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html)**.

So, we posted the message in the blog, and then we obliviously did something which heavily confused that message: We banned /r/thefappening and related subreddits. The confusion which was generated in the community was obvious, immediate, and massive, and we even had internal team members surprised by the combination. Why are we sending out a message about how we're being open as a platform, and not changing our stance, and then immediately banning the subreddits involved in this mess?


The answer is probably not satisfying, but it's the truth, and the only answer we've got. The situation we had in our hands was the following:  These subreddits were of course the focal point for the sharing of these stolen photos. The images which were DMCAd were continually being reposted constantly on the subreddit. We would takedown images (thumbnails) in response to those DMCAs, but it quickly devolved into a game of whack-a-mole. We'd execute a takedown, someone would adjust, reupload, and then repeat. This same practice was occurring with the underage photos, requiring our constant intervention. The mods were doing their best to keep things under control and in line with the [site rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules), but problems were still constantly overflowing back to us. Additionally, many nefarious parties recognized the popularity of these images, and started spamming them in various ways and attempting to infect or scam users viewing them. It became obvious that we were either going to have to watch these subreddits constantly, or shut them down. We chose the latter. It's obviously not going to solve the problem entirely, but it will at least mitigate the constant issues we were facing. This was an extreme circumstance, and we used the best judgement we could in response.

---

Now, after all of the context from above, I'd like to respond to some of the common questions and concerns which folks are raising. To be extremely frank, I find *some* of the lines of reasoning that have generated these questions to be batshit insane. Still, in the vacuum of information which we have created, I recognize that we have given rise to much of this strife. As such I'll try to answer even the things which I find to be the most off-the-wall.

Q: You're only doing this in response to pressure from the public/press/celebrities/Conde/Advance/other!

A: The press and nature of this incident obviously made this issue extremely public, but it was not the reason why we did what we did. If you read all of the above, hopefully you can be recognize that the actions we have taken were our own, for our own internal reasons. I can't force anyone to believe this of course, you'll simply have to decide what you believe to be the truth based on the information available to you.


Q: Why aren't you banning these other subreddits which contain deplorable content?!

A: We remove what we're required to remove by law, and what violates any [rules](http://www.reddit.com) which we have set forth. Beyond that, we feel it is necessary to maintain as neutral a platform as possible, and to let the communities on reddit be represented by the actions of the people who participate in them. I believe the [blog post](http://www.redditblog.com/2014/09/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own.html) speaks very well to this.

We have banned /r/TheFappening and related subreddits, for reasons I outlined above.



Q: You're doing this because of the IAmA app launch to please celebs!

A: No, I can say absolutely and clearly that the IAmA app had zero bearing on our course of decisions regarding this event. I'm sure it is exciting and intriguing to think that there is some clandestine connection, but it's just not there.


Q: Are you planning on taking down all copyrighted material across the site?

A: We take down what we're required to by law, which may include thumbnails, in response to valid DMCA takedown requests. Beyond that we tell claimants to contact whatever host is actually serving content. This policy will not be changing.



Q: You profited on the gold given to users in these deplorable subreddits! Give it back / Give it to charity!

A: This is a tricky issue, one which we haven't figured out yet and that I'd welcome input on. Gold was purchased by our users, to give to other users. Redirecting their funds to a random charity which the original payer may not support is not something we're going to do. We also do not feel that it is right for us to decide that certain things should not receive gold. The user purchasing it decides that. We don't hold this stance because we're money hungry (the amount of money in question is small).




That's all I have. Please forgive any confusing bits above, it's very late and I've written this in urgency. I'll be around for as long as I can to answer questions in the comments.

293oqs,umbrae,New reddit features: Controversial indicator for comments and contest mode improvements,1403737764.0,admin,1403737963.0,False,True,False,t3_293oqs,4637,False,1760,"Hey reddit,

We've got some updates for you after our recent change (you know, that one where we stopped displaying inaccurate upvotes and downvotes and broke a bunch of bots by accident). We've been listening to what you all had to say about it, and there's been some very legit concerns that have been raised. Thanks for the feedback, it's been a lot but it's been tremendously helpful.

First: **We're trying out a simple controversial indicator on comments that hit a threshold of up/downvote balance.**

It's a typographical dagger, and it looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/s5dTVpq.png

We're trying this out as a result of feedback on folks using ups and downs in RES to determine the controversiality of a comment. This isn't the same level of granularity, but it also is using only real, unfuzzed votes, so you should be able to get a decent sense of when something has seen some controversy.

You can turn it on in your preferences here: http://i.imgur.com/WmEyEN9.png

Mods & Modders: this also adds a 'controversial' CSS class to the whole comment. I'm curious to see if any better styling comes from subreddits for this - right now it's pretty barebones.

Second: **Subreddit mods now see contest threads sorted by top rather than random.**

Before, mods could only view contest threads in random order like normal users: now they'll be able to see comments in ranked order. This should help mods get a better view of a contest thread's results so they can figure out which one of you lucky folks has won.

Third: **We're piloting an upvote-only contest mode.**

One complaint we've heard quite a bit with the new changes is that upvote counts are often used as a raw indicator in contests, and downvotes are disregarded. With no fuzzed counts visible that would be impossible to do. Now certain subreddits will be able to have downvotes fully ignored in contest threads, and only upvotes will count.

We are rolling this change a bit differently: it's an experimental feature and it's only for “approved” subreddits so far. If your subreddit would like to take part, please send a message to /r/reddit.com and we can work with you to get it set up.


Also, just some general thoughts. We know that this change was a pretty big shock to some users: this could have been handled better and there were definitely some valuable uses for the information, but we still feel strongly that putting fuzzed counts to rest was the right call. We've learned a lot with the help of captain hindsight. Thanks for all of your feedback, please keep sending us constructive thoughts whenever we make changes to the site.

P.S. If you're interested in these sorts of things, you should subscribe to /r/changelog - it's where we usually post our feature changes, these updates have been an exception.",False,0.72,
28hjga,Deimorz,"reddit changes: individual up/down vote counts no longer visible, ""% like it"" closer to reality, major improvements to ""controversial"" sorting",1403120379.0,admin,1403123243.0,False,True,False,t3_28hjga,14002,False,0,"""Who would downvote this?"" It's a common comment on reddit, and is fairly often followed up by someone explaining that reddit ""fuzzes"" the votes on everything by adding fake votes to posts in order to make it more difficult for bots to determine if their votes are having any effect or not. While it's always been a necessary part of our anti-cheating measures, there have also been a lot of negative effects of making the specific up/down counts visible, so we've decided to remove them from public view.

The ""false negativity"" effect from fake downvotes is especially exaggerated on very popular posts. It's been observed by quite a few people that every post near the top of the frontpage or /r/all seems to drift towards showing ""55% like it"" due to the vote-fuzzing, which gives the false impression of reddit being an extremely negative site. As part of hiding the specific up/down numbers, we've also decided to start showing much more accurate percentages here, and at the time of me writing this, the top post on the front page has gone from showing ""57% like it"" to ""96% like it"", which is much closer to reality.

(Edit: since people seem confused, the ""% like it"" is only on *submissions*, as it always has been.)

As one other change to go along with this, /u/umbrae recently rolled out a much improved version of the ""controversial"" sorting method. You should see the new algorithm in effect in threads and sorts within the past week. Older sorts (like ""all time"") may be out of date while we work to update old data. Many of you are probably accustomed to ignoring that sorting method since the previous version was almost completely useless, but please give the new version another shot. It's available for use with submissions as a tab (next to ""new"", ""hot"", ""top""), and in the ""sorted by"" dropdown on comments pages as well.

This change may also have some unexpected side-effects on third-party extensions/apps/etc. that display or otherwise use the specific up/down numbers. We've tried to take various precautions to make the transition smoother, but please let us know if you notice anything going horribly wrong due to it.

I realize that this probably feels like a very major change to the site to many of you, but since the data was actually misleading (or outright false in many cases), the usefulness of being able to see it was actually mostly an illusion.

**We allow ad buyers to tailor ads based on a user’s country or metropolitan area. We are now signaling posts that have location targeting on them. We are adding more information about how location targeting affects you in the privacy policy.**

* reddit has allowed ad buyers to tailor ads to your computer’s general location (your country or metropolitan area) as signaled by your computer’s IP address.

* We will let you know when an ad is location-based with simple icons (http://www.reddit.com/wiki/targetingbycountrycity). You should know that interacting with a location-based ad could reveal your computer’s general location (since some ads — like for a music venue in San Francisco — are only seen in some geographies).

**We will be launching reddit Mobile apps.  The information they collect will be governed by the same privacy practices governing the reddit website.**

* If you use the app without signing in to reddit, it will store your in-app activity, but not link it to your reddit account.  
* If you use an app while signed in to reddit, we will associate your app-based activity with your account as if you were browsing the reddit website.
* As is the case with our website, we only use information collected via the app to provide our service, and we never disclose it unless required by law or in an emergency. 
* The app uses Google Analytics so we can learn how groups of users interact with it.
* Deleting your reddit account may not delete the information collected by the app if you previously backed up the app’s information elsewhere.
* A reddit app may also allow you to post to social media, including Facebook or Twitter, but reddit will not connect to the servers of those services, share information with those services, or post on your behalf.

As you may have heard, reddit quickly patched its SSL endpoints against server attack of the infamous heartbleed vulnerability. However, the heartbleed vulnerability has been around for quite some time, and up until it was publicly disclosed reddit's SSL endpoints were vulnerable.

Additionally, our application was found to have a client-side vulnerability to heartbleed which allowed memory to be leaked to external servers. We quickly addressed this after it was reported to us. Exploiting this vulnerability required the use of a specific API call on reddit, and we have analyzed our logs and found nothing to suggest that this API call was being exploited en masse. However, the vulnerability did exist.

Given these two circumstances, it is recommended that you [change your reddit password](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) as a precaution. Updating your password will log you out of all other reddit.com sessions. We also recommend that you make use of a unique, [strong](http://xkcd.com/936/) password on any site you use. The most common way accounts on reddit get broken into is by attackers exploiting [password reuse](http://xkcd.com/1286/).

It is also strongly recommended, though not required, that you set an email address on your reddit account. If you were to ever forget your password, we cannot contact you to reset it if we don't have your email address. We do not sell or otherwise make your email address available to third-parties, as indicated in our [privacy policy](http://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy#p_13).

As you may have noticed, the site is back up and running. There are still a few things moving pretty slowly, but for the most part the site functionality should be back to normal.

For those curious, here are some of the nitty-gritty details on what happened:

This morning around 8am PST, the entire site suddenly ground to a halt. Every request was resulting in an error indicating that there was an issue with our memcached infrastructure. We performed some manual diagnostics, and couldn't actually find anything wrong.

With no clues on what was causing the issue, we attempted to manually restart the application layer. The restart worked for a period of time, but then quickly spiraled back down into nothing working. As we continued to dig and troubleshoot, one of our memcached instances spontaneously rebooted. Perplexed, we attempted to fail around the instance and move forward. Shortly thereafter, a second memcached instance spontaneously became unreachable.

Last night, our hosting provider had applied some patches to our instances which were eventually going to require a reboot. They notified us about this, and we had planned a maintenance window to perform the reboots far before the time that was necessary. A postmortem followup seems to indicate that these patches were not at fault, but unfortunately at the time we had no way to quickly confirm this.

With that in mind, we made the decision to restart each of our memcached instances. We couldn't be certain that the instance issues were going to continue, but we felt we couldn't chance memcached instances potentially rebooting throughout the day.

Memcached stores its entire dataset in memory, which makes it extremely fast, but also makes it completely disappear on restart. After restarting the memcached instances, our caches were completely empty. This meant that every single query on the site had to be retrieved from our slower permanent data stores, namely Postgres and Cassandra.

Since the entire site now relied on our slower data stores, it was far from able to handle the capacity of a normal Wednesday morn. This meant we had to turn the site back on very slowly. We first threw everything into read-only mode, as it is considerably easier on the databases. We then turned things on piece by piece, in very small increments. Around 4pm, we finally had all of the pieces turned on. Some things are still moving rather slowly, but it is all there.

We still have a lot of investigation to do on this incident. Several unknown factors remain, such as why memcached failed in the first place, and if the instance reboot and the initial failure were in any way linked.

In the end, the infrastructure is the way we built it, and the responsibility to keep it running rests solely on our shoulders. While stability over the past year has greatly improved, we still have a long way to go. We're very sorry for the downtime, and we are working hard to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

cheers,

alienth

tl;dr

Bad things happened to our cache infrastructure, requiring us to restart it completely and start with an empty cache. The site then had to be turned on very slowly while the caches warmed back up. It sucked, we're very sorry that it happened, and we're working to prevent it from happening again. Oh, and [thanks for the bananas](/r/downtimebananas).",False,0.89,
me5e9,reddit,American Censorship Day - Stand up for ████ ███████ ,1321427616.0,admin,False,False,True,False,t3_me5e9,3095,False,5460,"reddit,

Today, the US House Judiciary Committee has a hearing on the [Stop Online Piracy Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) or SOPA. The text of the bill is [here](http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf). This bill would strengthen copyright holders' means to go after allegedly infringing sites at detrimental cost to the freedom and integrity of the Internet. As a result, we are joining forces with organizations such as the EFF, Mozilla, Wikimedia, and the FSF for [American Censorship Day](http://americancensorship.org/).

Part of this act would undermine the [safe harbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor) provisions of the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) which would make sites like reddit and YouTube liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. This act would also force search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with allegedly infringing sites, in effect, walling off users from them.

This bill sets a chilling precedent that endangers everyone's right to freely express themselves and the future of the Internet. If you would like to voice your opinion to those in Washington, please consider [writing your representative](https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml) and the sponsors of this bill:

Right now we are still a bit degraded, but we have enough servers to handle the weekend traffic (we think).  We hope to be at full capacity by Monday.

We want to tell you why reddit was down.

In short, Amazon had a failure of their EBS system, which is a data storage product they offer, at around 1:15am PDT.  This may sound familiar, because it was the same type of failure that took us down a month ago. This time however the failure was more widespread and affected a much larger portion of our servers (and not just ours, many other companies were affected as well).  Namely, most of our database slaves were disabled from this outage. Even though we are spread across multiple availability zones (data centers), it did us no good in this case, since the outage was so widespread and hit multiple availability zones.

Since that last failure, we have been doing everything we can to move ourselves off of the EBS product.  We're about half way there.  All of our Cassandra nodes are now using only local disk, and we hope to have all of postgres on local disk soon.

We will continue to use Amazon's other services as we have been.  They have some work to do on the EBS product, and they are aware of that and working on it.  The other services that we use are still performing as expected.

That being said, if you work for another hosting platform and believe you can make a compelling offering, please contact us at hosting@reddit.com, and we'll get back to you in a few days.

The team and I have been up the last two nights waiting for this issue to get fixed on the Amazon side so that we could bring the site up as soon as possible.  Because of this, we probably won't be around much to answer questions in the comments here, but feel free to talk amongst yourselves.  :)

[[screenshot](http://www.reddit.com/help/toolbar)]

It's especially useful when opening a bunch of links up in background tabs, solving the issue of ""Why did I open [this random picture](http://www.reddit.com/tb/eohp9) two hours ago?""

It's also turned out to be a good de facto reddit shortlink system. Instead of having to pass around this mouthful:

    http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/em5zw/father_and_son_launch_an_hd_camera_and_an_iphone/

You can just use the toolbar link:

    http://reddit.com/em5zw

This is what the ""share"" button has always done, by the way (have you ever tried it?) Your friend gets a link to the toolbar version, and this way they can see the content, the headline and, should they desire to go exploring, a way to get to the comments. Ideally this will lead them to create an account, and thus reddit moves one step closer to world domination.

Anyway, the reason we're writing about all this today is that we've acquired the domain `redd.it`, shaving a few characters off our shortlinks and bringing them down to a size where we can put them in the sidebar. (Do you see this submission's shortlink up there on the right?)

    FAQ:
    Q1. Is reddit entering the URL shortening business?
    A1. No. We just acquired a cool domain and wanted to show it off.

Note for adblockers: If you made an exception for reddit the simple way (by clicking the stop sign and saying ""Disable on reddit.com""), that'll apply to every link you visit in the toolbar. If you only want to make an exception within reddit, and keep adblock on for external sites viewed inside the toolbar frame, you should instead set things up as described in [/help/adblock](/help/adblock).

We'll end with a protip that, for whatever reason, not a lot of people know about. Skip it if you're easily confused: 

If you're on an external site, and you want to wrap the reddit toolbar around it, you can just prepend ""redd.it/"" to the existing URL. For example, if you're visiting a hot new search engine at `http://www.google.com`, just change that to `redd.it/http://www.google.com` (I know it looks funny, but go with it), and you'll be taken to the reddit page for that URL.

There's lots of [research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) out there on this kind of problem that we'd like to participate in. There's our [JSON API](http://www.reddit.com/.json), but that's just not enough for the in-depth analysis that we'd like to do and allow researchers to do.

We feel that opening up users' private data to researchers like that has to be done very carefully, and always with the permission of the users affected. So I'd like to announce that, from now on, we're going to share all your private data with DARPA. No, just kidding. Today we're adding a **new [preference](/prefs)** under ""privacy options"" called ""allow my data to be used for research purposes"". **By ticking that box you're agreeing to allow us to include certain data about you in big data dumps** like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/bubhl/csv_dump_of_reddit_voting_data/). This is **optional and opt-in**.

We want to make sure that everyone understands *exactly* what ticking that box will do. The data that you're giving us permission to reveal are:

* Your [community subscriptions](/reddits/mine)
* Your list of [friends](/prefs/friends) **edit1** none of *their* data, just that you friended them **edit2** only friends that have *also* opted in would be listed
* Non-content information about private reddits that you post in (that is, we may share *that* you posted there, but not *what* you posted)
* Your browser's user-agent
* Information on spam reports that you've filed (the `report` button)

On a separate tickbox, you can also share your voting history so that people can see your `liked` and `disliked` pages (this has been there since 2005). Either of these tickboxes will mean that you give us permission to share this voting data. Some items we're considering but want to talk to you about are:

* The last time you visited reddit at the time of the data-dump (in general this can be approximated from your last vote)
* The first two octets of your IP address (that is, if you're at 1.2.3.4, we may reveal that you're at 1.2.x.x)
* A [one-way hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of your email address **edit** looks like this one's out, lots of people seem uncomfortable with it

**Please tell us if you think that any of these are going too far**, especially if you'd tick the box but for one or two of the data involved.

If we ever change or add to this list, we'll reset everyone back to the default of `off` (and/or implement a more granular set of research-related preferences), so you don't have to worry about us sneaking things in there while you're asleep. **You're not agreeing to let us start telling everyone about every link you click or anything like that without your knowledge**. You are not agreeing to let us share the actual content of your private reddits, and **if you do not tick the preference we will not share this data against your will**. This is for research dumps. We're not going to be fielding requests for data about individual users. We're not trying to share identifiable information and in the general case we'll try to keep you anonymous but we all know that [that doesn't always work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_scandal) which is why this is **optional and opt-in**.

of new users. And now, as we get ready to turn the calendar to September,
we're starting to see the first signs of this annual phenomenon in our
traffic logs.

In past times like this, posts have popped up where the old farts formally
introduce themselves to the newcomers and get a good back-and-forth
going. This way, the latter can ask questions about the site and the former
can detail the precise way they'd like those darn kids to stay off their
lawn.

It's been a while since there's been one of these, so we thought we'd kick
one off today.

Some ideas to get everyone started:

Normally such a thing would cause our web monitoring software to freak out and wake us all up, but unfortunately it looks like that *also* went down at some point (that isn't on EC2 at all).

Again, apologies for the inconvenience.

**EDIT:**  Here's the post mortem.  It looks like we were hit by a bug similar to [this Ubuntu bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/276476).  As you can see, the bug was fixed in a later version of the kernel.  However, the way EC2 works, we can't upgrade the kernel ourselves.  What I can do is switch to a new base image, but I hadn't, mostly because there were always higher priority things to do, and it was never really a problem before.

As for the monitoring, it looks like our monitoring server experienced a power failure sometime yesterday, and the UPS failed, and then it failed to reboot cleanly.

So what are we doing to fix the problem and prevent this type of failure in the future?  First, I'm going to add a second monitor on a Slicehost machine that has been generously donated by a trusted reddit user, and then I'm going to have the two monitors watch each other.  After that, I'm going build a new instance for our load balancer that is on the most recent version of Ubuntu, and does not have that nasty kernel bug.",False,0.87,

So what happened?  We do not actually control the ad box on the right -- that is outsourced to a company called DART.  We share an account with the rest of Conde, so multiple people have access to this.  Someone accidentally put in the wrong ad for the wrong site, and you saw the result.

If you turn AdBlock off, you will see that we have disabled the box ad and replaced it with something else until we can find out what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.

**What will we be doing?**  We will be performing part two of the maintenance we started [three weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/tb/amumr).  We will be upgrading memcached and memcachedb, and their supporting system libraries.  It turns out we are two major revisions behind, and we'd like to take advantage of some of the new improvements, like the binary protocol.

**Why?** We hope this will further enhance site performance, and make page load times even faster!

**I thought you are ""in the cloud"".  Why can't you do it with no downtime?**  The cloud is not a magic bullet, and we are cheap and lazy.  We could in theory bring up a bunch of new machines that are already upgraded to replace the machines we will be upgrading, but it turns out that moving the data would be a big pain.  So instead we will just take the site down for a bit to do the upgrade in place.

The beauty of the cloud, however, is that we'll have a backup instance already booted and configured if something goes wrong.

**Ok, but why do you have to take the site down?**  One of the things that we are upgrading are the permacaches, which use memcachedb (see previous blog post).  Because of the way we access them, they are currently a single point of failure for us.  We hope to resolve that in the future, but in the meantime, we can't take one of them down without breaking the site, so we'll just take them all down at once.

As some of you may already be aware, certain users are receiving private messages – ostensibly from moderators of large subreddits – in which they are told that they've won a gift card, a cash prize, or a robotic ferret. (I may have made that last one up.) Anyway, we wanted to take a moment to inform everyone of the following:

**If you receive a private message telling you that you've won something, it is a scam.**

There are a number of ways that illicit accounts operate on Reddit. More often than not, spammers pump up their karma scores until they're past a certain threshold, then either sell their accounts or start submitting links to malware-infested websites and shady retail outlets. ([This brief guide](https://redd.it/3jss04) will tell you how to spot them... and if that's too long for you, [this tongue-in-cheek video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) will offer the same information.)

More recently, though, we've seen this new breed of parasite making the rounds. They register usernames that look like they could be associated with various Reddit communities (provided that you don't examine their profile pages too closely), then they contact users directly, thereby bypassing most of what moderators can do to combat them. If you receive one of their messages, here's what to do:

1. Do not click any of the links that it provides.
2. [Report the account to the administrators](https://www.reddit.com/report).
3. Block the account in question.

Remember, everyone, if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.

However, he was ecstatic that he was finally going to lose his virginity with his new girlfriend. While in town with his brother, he remembered that he needed to buy condoms.

""Way here, I nee do buy thum connomth."" he said, as they passed a pharmacy.

He walked inside and stood in front of the counter. ""Thum connomth, bleath."" he said to the clerk.

The clerk just gazed at him, and cocked an eyebrow. ""Say what now?"" he asked, amusedly.

Jerrold tried to enunciate clearly. ""Thum connomth. A backa connomth, bleath.""

The clerk just shook his head. ""No idea what you just said, bud.""

Jerrold frowned and color rushed to his face in frustration. ""Con-nomth. Fow da penith. Fow thex. With a gowl.""

The clerk just shrugged, shook his head, and started wiping the counter. Jerrold growled and stormed outside.

""What happened?"" asked his brother.

Jerrold recounted the whole exasperating experience.

""Look,"" said his brother, ""here's what you do. Whip out your dick, lay it on the counter, and slam a dollar beside it. He'll know what you mean.""

Jerrold grinned at the genius of the idea, and went back into the shop.

A minute later, he walked back out, crying.

""What happened now?"" his brother asked.

Jerrold wiped his tears with the back of his hand. ""Wewl, I nid what you thaid. I whibbed out my dick and butt it onna counner, and bud a dollow bethide it.""

""Yeah, and what did he say?""

I've been playing video games since.. Since I can remember. The first time I played purble place then to gta vice City, then assassins creed, and all the way to Vegas and Boston with the fallout games and today destiny 2, star wars and so many others I have fond memories with.. 

Today I stood up to my abusive dad and well.. My PC is now being sold off as.. Punishment 

This beautiful community,  where I've felt so welcome, where the colour of our skin, the way we look and what we are doesn't matter but the fact that we share this passion, this hobby or this simple past time.. All these helped me through my depression, my dark times and helped me live a happier life, where I could take out my frustrations and my worries by shooting deathclaws in the face and air assassinating random soldiers. The gaming community took me along, pulled me along through the dark times as if determined to help push through, no matter what happened, where i found lifelong friends along the way and the experiences I had which will never leave me.

Today I cried knowing I'm losing my friends, people i consider close and this community, gaming in general which I love so much and that held my hand through all the sad times and I'll miss this community. From the rage monsters, the Asian pvp gods the just the salt of the earth regular people, carrying me Through the toughest missions while I have the lowest stat armour. 

Hopefully when I can afford it, on my own two feet where I don't deal with abuse I can come back, see and experience this community again. 

Thank you for all the memories you guys. One day I'll be back to farm All the loot I miss out on.

Post-apocalyptic Earth, you're revived by some strange entity with no memory of your past, and incredible abilities. You learn about the darkness, the greatest threat to humanity's survival there ever was, that literally derailed humanity and made it almost extinct. 


Destiny had a mediocre first game because they failed spectacularly to capitalize on that concept. House of wolves was probably one of the best, other than the taken King. But everything else was just so barren. There was no dimension to the story at all, just a lot of grinding involved. kill lots of this, run this strike x amount of times in hope of getting some gear. But the story was just so... Shallow. what am I here for? Why was I revived? What happened to the world? So many unanswered questions that we didn't get to playthrough. No cutscenes, or storylines, just generic vague answers that a handful of unbelievable characters reiterate to death. 


Fast forward to Destiny 2. They haven't done anything right. They choose to kill off one of the beloved main characters to add content to the game in forsaken. Shadow keep you get to revisit the moon, which was in the first Destiny to begin with, they just wanted you to buy it back. There was some strange new entity calling out to you, reviving The Dead and making them float around you. but the story just wasn't there. It has no dimension, very poorly thought-out, even more poorly executed, and to top it all off, you're drawn away from the story from the individual seasons like Osiris, warmind, now the season of arrivals. The seasons were a spectacular fail because they introduced a concept of something returning, but it was just a grind. No actual story line, no content. Just grinding the same crap over and over again. 


This is the future we're talking about here. We could be exploring the moons of Saturn, learning about some nearly impossible to defeat threat that could take us several years. But nope. They introduce something that has four hours of content and you are able to save the Galaxy from certain Doom within a couple weeks. There's so much they can do with Destiny that they just didn't. That's why it's a steaming pile of trash. I mean, just look at Halo. It was this grandiose long stretched storyline that took you across the Galaxy and introduce you to several beloved characters that were believable and wanted you to care about them, and had dimension and depth and so much more. Destiny introduces you to characters that don't matter, puts you in situations where you have to do the same thing over and over again that you've already done, i.e nightfall strike is just harder version of a strike, Master nightfall is harder version of harder version of a strike, Grand Master nightfall is harder version of harder version of harder version of a strike.

The game consisted of 3 worlds (as far as i remember).  
One world is a grass-land and it consisted of a big house, which some animal lion-like humanoids lived in, and you could move them with your mouse. I remember one of them would play a concert in there.  


Another world was a swamp-land where i remember a pond which consisted of fish, there were coconut trees you could click on and the coconut would fall into the pond, i also remember a weird frog like creature which jumped there from time to time.  


The third world i remember consisted of an aquarium where there were jellyfish animals i could move around with my mouse.

I contacted customer support as more than anything I wanted to know why it was banned, I don't cheat and I don't really flip out at people so why ban me, Turns out it was some payment mix up with one of my credit cards, took over 6 weeks for them to get back to me, and in that time my entire library was unavailable to me.. which I had paid for I might add.

\------ 

Hello,  
 

Thank you for contacting us regarding the action that was taken on your account. After reviewing your case, we found that your account was banned due to a chargeback against EA. However, we have removed the ban and reinstated access to your account.  
 

EA takes chargebacks seriously and future chargebacks will ultimately result in permanent account closure.  
 

\------

It doesn't sit well with me that they can ban my entire game library that easily with very little in the way of me being able to get in contact with someone and had to wait six weeks for a response, i'll just not buy anything on Origin again and I won't run into any more mix ups but I'm old enough to remember the outcry gamers had when we where told we had to download steam to play Half life 2 and all the promises which where given at the time, I know Origin is a different company but the ease with which they think they can do this is scary to me.

I'm mainly talking about casual players, and how a lot of our online experience is tainted if not outright ruined by wannabe hardcore players. Or in fighting games players who just spam but that's an a separate issue of them being horrible people. 

Not every multiplayer game has casual modes and competitive/ranked modes. 

And even the ones that do, there's sometimes people who just like to go in and play like they're in ranked and their life depends on it.

My fighting games are pretty much ruined for me because of this. And I'm saying this as a player who is pretty damn good. But like when I started playing Dragonball Fighters I was told that it's best to just keep playing ranked, because unfortunately the casual online mode is full of people who are basically one with their controller.

Smash Ultimate is a wild experience in how I can be paired with an actual good player, and then the next is a Ness spammer. Smash online just sucks in general.

I feel like online Vs. games, should have an extra layer of matchmaking. Of course there's also smurf accounts and people who just make new accounts so they can feel better about themselves beating lower ranked players because they no longer win at their skill level. 

I don't know the solution but I think I'm not the only one frustrated in some games because I'm trying to play casual but end up with some person who probably detects every frame in a match and spams the hell out of their controller.",False,0.5,

Pokémon has always been one of my favorite franchises, video games, card games, etc. of all time. My first Pokémon game was Pokémon Blue in 2000, I recieved it and a Game Boy Color for my 4th birthday, and this was my first ever team with my favorite Pokémon of all time, Blastoise, and my favorite Electric Type, Raichu.

Looking back, all of my teams were fairly well rounded, although I got lucky because I picked all of my Pokémon based on aesthetics from watching the anime religiously. Turtles are my favorite animals, so to have one as a starter that evolves to have cannons is magnificent.

I loved the episodes in the anime where Jigglypuff is stuck in the Blastoise's cannon, The March of the Exeggutor Squad, Beach Blank-Out Blastoise, The Battling Eevee brothers, the episode where they show that a Dragonite is a delivery Pokémon, and where Ash's Pikachu battles Brock's Onix and Lt. Surge's Raichu. They're most likely what I picked my team after.

After talking to my friend who didn't grow up with the video games, I decided to make collages of my first-run teams for each game I played. It gave me a strong sense of nostalgia, and reminded me that no matter how much Pokémon changes (or doesn't change) I'll always have many great memories with these games. Not all of the Pokémon on my teams are present in Sword & Shield, but that's ok, there will always be new Pokémon to train and make even more memories with.

 A few of my friends liked to play the Sims by Torturing them. For example one told me: He lured the neighbors in the basement und locked the door (only open for the owners) He then put easels in there and sold the paintings. There were only 3 beds for 10 people.
After several dass they all got mentally ill, but pretty good painters. His income was pretty high.

The games graphics are really nice but, the motion blur & grain makes it look bad so I reccomend you turn those off immediately. All in all the game is a nice open world game to play with music on while trying to 100% and the J. Jonah. Jameson remarks keep up the humor until you 100% it. The levels as Mary Jane and Miles Morales do make part of the game boring as they are mostly sneak levels. Another complaint that is more a bit pick is that the 2nd radioactive spider stayed on MaryJane for like 2/3 of the game and then when it got on Miles it immediately bite him.

There's a company called Marseille Inc. They make an HDMI cable with a built in processor that upscales video signals. It'll upscale old consoles - PS2, Wii - to 1080p ; anything PS360 gen and on up to 4K. I think there's built-in antialiasing. From what I've seen & read, latency is not an issue.

So ... wouldn't that be a great way to maximise a weaker PC processor? You could run something in 720p and get an easy upscale independent of your CPU/GPU.

They aren't milking a franchise in a bad way, such as Rockstar's GTAV or Bethesda's Skyrim, or putting out titles like Call of Duty which feel uninspired or bland and oversaturated. 

Starting with the Spyro trilogy, they really hit on the children's action platformers as Spyro was unique to Playstation and could co-exist with Crash even when gaming wasn't what it is today. Each Ratchet and Clank title from the 2000s was warranted as the series was geared towards minors which means going for the holiday market was easier when we didn't have social media, and each title added to an overall story while having enough content to last. 

Jump to now, they presented a surprise with Spider-Man: Miles Morales being just a temporary fix for a larger Spider-Man 2 title which I can't even fathom the size of. I'm not sure what happened behind the scenes with the Ratchet and Clank reboot's sequel, as it felt as if there was supposed to be a second one on the PS4, but they have decided to put so much into Rift Apart that it looks so indescribably good, even though there hasn't been gameplay put out as far as I know.

So I have had an extended hard drive for my PS4 plugged in for about a year now and I don't why I am just now asking this question, but here is the issue...

When I need to unplug it, I do the proper thing of shutting off the device first before unplugging, however when I keep it plugged in and don't touch it and then either shut off or rest mode my PS4 it will come back on and say I didn't ""Remove Extended HD"" before unplugging it.

Why does it say this? If I'm not unplugging it at all, how am I removing it wrong? Also there is very little a reason to even unplug it and I have maybe done it three times, but this message still comes up when I turn the PS4 on even when the HD was never unplugged to begin with.

I think my days of having an unattached controller and giving it to my little guy so he can ""play"" are wrapping up. He just hit four recently, and I like the idea of him starting to learn how to game at around the same age his dad did (Not going to lie I'm super pumped about it).I always thought that the NES Controller would be the best controller to get him to start playing with since it's relatively straight forward and wouldn't be overwhelming (plus I was born in the late 80's so it's what I started with too!).

So tonight, I went ahead and ordered 2 NES (Classic) controllers, and they're due to come in on Sunday/Monday. I was wondering if any of you knew of any games these days that would be basic enough to be played with an NES controller (and ok for a 4 year old to play). My initial thoughts are platformers would be a good go-to, but I'm pretty much up for anything that anyone can think of.  Feel free also to drop names of some games I can load up on an emulator as well (*ideally* I'd like to keep it simple for him so I can eventually teach him how to access the games on GoG galaxy/steam, but I mean that's a bridge I can cross later as well).

Anyways honestly, thank you so much ahead of time, guys! Gaming has always been a massive part of my life, and I'm kinda looking forward to this, because the little gaming we do, he finds amazing. I've been working full time/going to school full time and finally have my first full day off in two months next weekend.

I would LOVE to be able to just play through that game again, even if it was just a simple port (bonus points if they let you select your favorite UI from the different releases over the years).

If they REALLY wanted to be ambitious, though; I feel like it would be awesome to get an ACTUAL Story for the game. There was clearly a story going on in the background, but you never got a chance to really get to know these characters, not to mention see them form relationships.

I would love a story focused around Ash, and have all of these “default class templates” represented as canon characters. We’ve already seen MOST of them, albeit some more briefly than other (ie. Rupika, the FOnewearl).

The only four I don’t ever recall seeing were the original HUcast (which I would say is an easy fit for the military organization), and the three classes added in Episode 2.

For the HUcaseal, I would probably retcon her to be Great Sword Zuke’s personal guard (which makes more sense anyways), and maybe give her a little more personality. For the RAmarl, probably have her also part of the military organization, maybe investigating Black Paper’s ties to the original Pioneer ship.

As for the FOmar, I actually think it would be cool to introduce him as a simple scholar, but maybe later reveal he has ties to Black Paper (maybe the leader’s son?), but potentially redeem him somehow.

Which brings me to Kireek, the HUcast. Maybe the story could see Ash defeating him, but eventually being redeemed, or at least taking over Black Paper and taking the organization in a different direction. Kireek was super cool, and it was a bummer seeing him just “go crazy” as a weird, hard to find optional fight to get the SOUL EATER scythe weapon.

Like I said, though; I’d also be happy just getting a remaster. Maybe the default character models could be a BIT closer to the artwork, though, and maybe offer a “Reset/Default” option when using the Dressing Room feature and changing your appearance?

Beyond that, it would also be cool if you could unlock some of the NPC and unused character models to swap to. I remember using an Action Replay back on the GameCube to play as Sonic and Knuckles, plus the unused “ninja” character model. Those were just fun to use!",False,0.57,

If you don't want to side with Caesar, use the explosive exploit (30 Explosive skill check) in Cottonwood Cove to get idolized with Caesar's Legion and gain the safehouse key.

You can also max all skills by picking the skilled trait, rebuilding your character when you leave goodsprings. Then pick the skilled trait again.

As some of you may already be aware, certain users are receiving private messages – ostensibly from moderators of large subreddits – in which they are told that they've won a gift card, a cash prize, or a robotic ferret. (I may have made that last one up.) Anyway, we wanted to take a moment to inform everyone of the following:

**If you receive a private message telling you that you've won something, it is a scam.**

There are a number of ways that illicit accounts operate on Reddit. More often than not, spammers pump up their karma scores until they're past a certain threshold, then either sell their accounts or start submitting links to malware-infested websites and shady retail outlets. ([This brief guide](https://redd.it/3jss04) will tell you how to spot them... and if that's too long for you, [this tongue-in-cheek video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlrtcStl2bU) will offer the same information.)

More recently, though, we've seen this new breed of parasite making the rounds. They register usernames that look like they could be associated with various Reddit communities (provided that you don't examine their profile pages too closely), then they contact users directly, thereby bypassing most of what moderators can do to combat them. If you receive one of their messages, here's what to do:

1. Do not click any of the links that it provides.
2. [Report the account to the administrators](https://www.reddit.com/report).
3. Block the account in question.

Remember, everyone, if something seems too good to be true, it usually is.

That's why we don't have robotic ferrets yet, sadly.",False,0.99,

In terms of the backstory of the Fox spouses, it's almost as if Anderson truly understood the relationship between the two which Dahl intended with his limited examination of them in the book, and amplified it with dialogue soaking in chemistry and heartfelt moments. The comedy was also subtle but effective. And in the book Mr. Fox suggests that they are not bad animals, because it's not as if they're trying to kill humans. Just eat their food.

hgn63c,GlumExcitement9,Will Smith's movies where he ALMOST starred is way more compelling than his actual filmography.,1593232418.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hgn63c,185,False,335,"**Django Unchained** (2012) - Common knowledge. Apparently Tarantino wrote it for Will Smith and he was interested but he had some issues with Quentin's creative direction. I would have loved to see him in a Tarantino movie but I can't really see him as a silent cowboy that Jamie was, and I understand why he turned it down.

&#x200B;

**A Star Is Born** \- Way back in the day like in the early 2000's, Joel Schumacher was circling him and Jennifer Lopez for the leads. I remember reading that the roles were reversed. Jennifer Lopez was going to be the seasoned singer and Will Smith was the star. I think that would have been interesting but I can't imagine it being any better than the movie we ended up seeing.

&#x200B;

**Snake Eyes** (1998) - In Brian De Palma's Snake Eyes, Will was originally written to play Commander Dunne alongside Nicolas Cage and personally, I would have loved to see this. It would have been Will Smith's first villain role and it would have added a lot shock value at the reveal. Seeing him as a corrupt general would have been a great move for his career and is a shame he turned it down over a salary dispute.

&#x200B;

**Shaft** (2000) - John Singleton intended Will Smith as John Shaft II with Lauryn Hill who had just won six grammies. I would have liked to see that because it would be a departure into a more edgier role as Shaft is a pretty rough character. I would have liked to see him and John Singleton work together.

&#x200B;

**Inception** (2010) - Will Smith was considered with Brad Pitt to play Cobb with Leo. It goes to show how much confidence WB had in Nolan if Smith was the back-up if Leonardo DiCaprio turned it down. I can't see Will in it personally.

&#x200B;

**The Accountant** (2016) - Mel Gibson was attached to direct at one point with a huge interest in Will Smith starring in the main role. It's an interesting role for Smith considering the subject matter of the script and there's no doubt it would be any less than excellent if Mel Gibson directed him. Funny enough, Mel Gibson was interested in doing Suicide Squad 2 just for the prospect of working with Smith.

&#x200B;

**Triple Frontier** (2019) - The original iteration script was originally different and was going to be directed by Kathryn Bigelow. Smith was reportedly very interested and was supposed to star alongside Christian Bale and Sean Penn. I believe he was going to play a version of the Pope role which was played by Oscar Isaac later.

&#x200B;

**Phone Booth** (2002) - Will Smith was offered to play Stu in Phone Booth but turned it down because he didn't find the villain's motivation that all compelling.

&#x200B;

**Batman Forever** (1995) - Another Joel Schumacher project he was attached to. [He said he was in the running on Jay Leno.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1719&v=kRaXTgntjdo) Imagine Robin looking like he can kick Val Kilmer's Batman's ass.

&#x200B;

**Oldboy** (2013) - Him and Spielberg were developing a remake of Oldboy which was supposed to specifically draw from the graphic novel with Mark Protosevich writing. When Spielberg left the director's chair, Will left as well.

&#x200B;

**The Matrix** (1999) - Speaking of Val Kilmer and Will Smith, Will Smith was offered to be Neo and Matrix with the intention of Val Kilmer being Morpheus. Out of all these movies, Will Smith regrets turning this one down the most. He turned it down because he didn't understand what the concept was in the pitch meeting and wasn't completely confident the Wachowskis since they only made Bound before that, one feature prior.",False,0.83,

On the one hand it has amazing cinematography, a very solid, although subtle plot, with great subversions of expectation throughout.

The film's oppressive atmosphere is very effective, and I loved how lifeless everyone was. Even if that is something that others took issue with.

However, the one thing that I really just can't ignore is  just how slow and long the film is. 3 hours of long walking scenes, with the occasional flashpoint of tension is just not easy to get through, combined with the pointlessness of the main character, the lack  of comedy, and the dreary setting and characters it becomes difficult to stay attentive.

I'd compare it to something like 2001 by kubrick, a visually gorgeous film, with a pretty unique and interesting plotline, except that everything just takes so long to happen, and it can feel like watching paint dry, as you wait for the next scene to begin.

Overall, I still do think on paper 2049 is a great film, but one that was way too drawn out considering it's tone for most people to find interesting. If they had just sped everything up a bit, I might have called it a masterpiece.

The father is white and can see that his wife is in denial about his son. The mother brings up a few times her gender politics by saying: ""Don't use that word to describe woman in power"" when the Luce and his father call Luce's teacher a ""bitch"". 
That would be my first question: I felt that Nicole Kidmann was criticised for her political stance on things. She adopted Luce when she could have had a child of her own, the father saying at one point ""I didn't choose to make our lives to be a big political statement"". She wants Luce to feel accepted in every way and yet traps him in his role of ""saved child from Africa who will succeed in life"". Luce isn't alowed to fail. He cannot show who he is.


- Many people are angry at Luce for protecting his friends after they sexually abused his girlfriend. But that is what I find so fascinating about Luce in a way, it might be crazy but here is my logic: Luce despises expectations. I am formulating here, he says:"" Why do you get accepted when you're a poster boy and rejected if you are not?"". When he talks with his friend who got kicked out of school for possessing drugs in his locker, he talks to him in such a respectful and uplifting way: ""The team is worse without you"". Luce doesn't punish his friend for hanging out with bad guys, he doesn't punish misbehaviors. Because, my belief being, he wants people around him to feel accepted even when they act terribly. He acts terribly himself towards his teacher, and he knows he cannot be who he actually is around people. He has to keep a smile and be the perfect football champion that people percieve him to be.


- It is a movie about acceptance and expectations. That is why the commiters of the sexual abuse aren't demonized. But the pain from the abusee is shown with great respect.


- Now about the conversation Luce had with his teacher at the end of the movie, and the speech.. Luce now understands that he cannot change the system, and chooses to be part of it, to decide what the new societal expectations will be. He realises that he has to play the game to win it. 


- Luce is a force of nature, an angry, bitter but rightful one.


- And one last thing, when Nicole Kidmann sees Luce having sex with his ex, I wonder what thoughts are crossing through her mind. I think she understands now that was all a plot, but I believe something happened to her. She understand that she had to stop. That she was part of the problem too.",False,0.5,Discussion

What I hear is that the movie is guilty of having a White Savior complex which I partially agree. Skeeter (Emma Stone) shows up and decides to write a book using the stories of Black maids in the South but as the story continues, it becomes less about Skeeter and more about Abilene and Minnie. 

Those two African-American women are the heart and soul of the movie. We see Abilene finally stand up to the racist Hilly, we're moved by Abilene's tragic story of loss and how it affects her. With Minnie, arguably the biggest highlight of The Help is when she offers Hilly a ""shit pie"". These women fought back in a era where they couldn't even look at a white, rich woman with a frown.  Whereas Skeeter, ""the White savior"", turns into the ditzy love-struck girl she once despised when she falls for a creep who turns out to be a racist. Skeeter takes a back-seat story-wise. It's not really a movie about Skeeter coming into town and helping the poor, Black maids. I think many of the people who hate The Help might not have seen it.

\- Contagion, for obvious reasons.

\- Joker, a story about a guy who loses his job and health insurance and triggers a riot against police.

\- V For Vendetta, a far-right government seizes control of a divided England while a pandemic devastates the USA (in the year 2020 btw).

\- Lego Movie, if only because it revolves around a resistance to ""President Business"", a CEO-turned-despot who likes detaining people but secretly just wants to be loved.

\- Do The Right Thing, it was always a deeply insightful dive into American racism that critics were slow to recognize as a true classic, but it's lessons are more relevant now than ever. The climax of the film involves police arriving, choking an innocent black man to death, and then abandoning the neighborhood to the riot they incited. Watchers today might find that climax almost too on the nose.

\- Parasite, though I'm cheating a bit on this one because the whole movie is loaded with intentional allegory to the modern world, but even so I have to admire the wisdom of its symbolism - the rainstorm that only harmed the rich family's camping trip ends up devastating the poor family's home, for instance. Probably climate change metaphor, but I think it maps perfectly to covid-19 as well.

\- Oh, and on the flipside, The Dark Knight Rises, which ends with a platoon of hero cops (all male, ever notice that? Gotham has like one female officer in the whole series and she turns out to be corrupt) charging against a swarm of property-destroying anarchists to heroically beat the shit out of them and restore order. Yes this is justified by the plot, but the messaging and imagery may well go down as ""not aged well"". I feel like Joker is a photo negative of this movie in a lot of ways.

I was pretty young when it came out, but I remember it always being on tv when I was in high school/early college and I remember liking it, but I just thought there was way too much fluff and that it was too long. But I recently purchased it and watched it in 4K on a massive TV with surround sound, and I was kind of blown away. It pretty much locked up a bunch of awards before the end of the 15th minute. 

Well, first, the intro music and opening aerial shots are freaking amazing. Then we meet this extremely bright-blue-eyed little kid living next to this beautiful river in the highlands of Scotland, he first finds his village people hanging in a barn, then he loses his dad and brother who fought in a battle of some kind (giving the audience a little taste of how brutal life has been for the majority of history), and the funeral was intense, and then his old and wise uncle shows up, and then he wakes up that night to hear bagpipes playing the most beautiful music ever created on a hill with fires all around, then he looks at his uncles sword, grabs it, and then his uncle tells him first to use his head, then he will teach him to use the sword. You could just tell that this was going to be an amazing ride of a movie and that this little kid was going to fuck shit up in the future. 

And then the slow and necessary build up 30-minute second act where we see him return grown up, and he falls in love and marries this beautiful woman who he knew from childhood. A lot of people complain about this part, but if you have ever been in love, then you know exactly what this dude is feeling, especially the very beginning of the love. It is something that cant be described really. And the movie makers did a wonderful job getting the audience to be 1000% emotionally committed with this. And then his new love was taken away from him and we immediately know that revenge will be his prime motivation and that many, many people are going to die because of what just happened. And we haven't even gotten to the battle scenes yet. It was just such an awesome movie with some of the best camera work, score, editing, everything is top-notch. And for 1995? Unheard of. It really hits home emotionally for me now that im in my early 30's, and I think it may be one of my favorite movies now.

And Glatatior. What can I say? The opening battle in that movie will always be one of my favorites, even if some of the editing is complete shit. I think Joaquin Phoenix's performance is probably one of the best ever, and I still dont understand how Russel Crowe got a best actor for his performance. He was good and all, but an Oscar? It was brutal seeing him find his wife and son, and he defiantly made you feel for him, but come on.

Featuring a stellar cast (Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Cliff Curtis, Hiroyuki Sanada), Sunshine offers an intelligent narrative with dazzling visuals. It isn't as quick-paced as you'd expect, it's a slow-moving sci-fi which becomes more eerie as it goes along. Some critics disliked the film for turning into a slasher, I disagree. The change actually makes the story more absorbing whereas before I was beginning to lose my patience because it began to drag and a plot-twist had to happen. 

With it said, Sunshine doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, a art-house sci-fi or a scary space opera. I got the impression the director had more ambition as opposed to a plot-line. 

Also, the women characters are completely underused. The characters played by Michelle Yeoh and Rose Byrne could have been killed in the first fifteen minutes and it wouldn't change anything about the story.

It was my most anticipated film of the year and while it didn't fully meet my high expectations (big fan of Gray's previous film *The Lost City of Z*, among his other films), it still was one hell of a solid Sci-Fi Drama with a terrific lead performance by Brad Pitt, exceptional production values and a sincere emotional core behind it. I had been meaning to rewatch it for a while and when I saw a copy at a local DVD shop had to going for 14 bucks or so, I went for it.

In my second viewing, I felt I was able to get in more line with what it was going for. Lately, I've been depressed and angry with what's been going on in the United States and watching this almost acted as a reflection to those feelings. I feel alone and honestly pretty miserable lately, which is a contrast to my usual optimistic self. Even when I'm talking with friends and family, I feel like I have to put up a facade (even moreso with the Fox News watching members of my family). So in watching a movie about a guy with depression but eventually overcoming it, it gives me a little hope that I'll be able to find it in the future. If a guy up in space can find catharsis at the edge of the universe, who says I can't?

Also some additional notes:

- I wish James Gray had more creative control over this than he did, though his creative finger prints are all over it in a lot of ways (the rover chase is pretty similar to that of the car chase from *We Own The Night*, the core story being about familial ties and relationships, etc.).

- It's interesting how this and *Interstellar* share similarities towards their visual styles and ultimate messages about humanity, even though their approaches couldn't be any more different. 

- A leftover from my pervious viewing but I'm surprised people say the movie is slow; I always thought it went by quick and the first half hour alone packs in a lot.

- That Baboon scene is scary as hell lol.

- Max Richter's score is terrific, as is Lorne Bafle's contributions.

- The standard Blu-Ray looks and sounds great. Could only imagine what it looks like in 4K.

- A friend of mine noted the amount of similarities between Roy McBride and Shinji Ikari, to which I retorted ""Roy is basically Shinji if he actually got in the fucking robot"".

Anyways, having watched all these older movies it’s really neat to see these actors and see how they became famous and why they became stars. For me personally, I never really understood why someone like Kirk Douglas was a star, I just knew him as Spartacus, or Humphrey Bogart, I just knew him as a scrawny looking dude that was in a ton of classic movies. I never knew who Robert Mitchum or Gene Tierney or Edward G Robinson were, but now they’re all some of my favorite actors. Who are your favorite classic stars? In what movie did you see them in that made you see why they were a great actor? Like for me it was Robert Mitchum in ‘Night of the Hunter’. Seeing him go from 'Out of the Past' to 'Night of the Hunter' was pretty awesome to see, and made me really respect him.

Also, in case you guys are interested in the genre, here’s some of my favorite film noirs, specifically from the late '30s to '50s era. What are some of yours?

Out of the Past (1947)

The Third Man (1949)

Laura (1944)

The Killing (1956)

How do people feel about these kind of movies when viewed through a modern lens and going by today's standards in the context of gender equality, female empowerment vs objectification, toxic masculinity, #metoo, consent, etc kind of things?

&#x200B;

Aside from the general theme of these movies, which generally revolve around the female characters only being there to be preyed upon or manipulated into satisfying the sexual urges of the male characters and especially in the series of never ending sequels under the American Pie title, there are particular scenes that I just don't think would fly nowadays. Take the first movie, for example, with the iconic scene where Jim sets up a webcam to secretly broadcast Nadia's undressing. 

&#x200B;

I've often found it quite perculiar how these kind of movies seem to have avoided any sort of backlash despite there being a somewhat credible argument that they kind of glorify this type of behaviour / attitude in young males which is undeniably rampant, compared to the backlash that violent or offensive movies / games get when (loosely) associated acts of violence are relatively few and far between.

I think Ruby Rose fits the book's description of Devi Morris pretty well, but I can think of a couple other actresses who'd do well in the part - Emily Blunt comes to mind, as does Charlize Theron, or it could be a good breakout change of pace for Emma Stone perhaps.

What you might not have known though is the movie has a more tragic story that happened behind the scenes, with the underdog director fighting for their vision of the movie to happen, and sadly in this instance, the underdog didnt win. A major focus of the movie where the LGBT themes of the movie, including Angus' father, played by the late great Larry Drake(Darkman, Firefly, Johnny Bravo), who was gay and married in the original film. Additionally, Van Der Beek and Bate's characters were also gay, with Van Der Beek's character projecting his self hate into Angus because he hates the fact Angus is not afraid to be himself. These story plots were critical to the story, and were completely washed from the movie after studios had test screenings where young teenagers in the audience began making homophobic comments at Angus' father. Despite Johnson being offered 500k to drop the leave the project, which he rejected, he continued to fight for his cut until the studio went behind his back and released their own cut of the film, with Angus' father *dead* rather than being gay, and any other gay sub themes scrubbed out completely. The subsequent release focused the movie on teenagers instead of college aged crowds, billing it as a comedic duo comedy, which the movie itself had heavy themes of bullying, abuse, and death in it, miles above what the studio tried to reimagine it as. The movie flopped commercially, leaving behind a legacy that grew as time went by, with the people who did see it connecting to the characters, the soundtrack, and the story.

The movie's rights are currently privately owned away from a major studio, never really having a release of any kind with the exception of a dvd in the late 00s, but it deserves to have not only a rerelease, but the original vision the cast and crew made see the light of day.

hgclqn,k_akroom,There's a scene in the Birdcage (1996) that I never got that I think I do now that I really like,1593194636.0,,1593195875.0,False,True,False,t3_hgclqn,3,False,0,"So because quarantine the Birdcage is free on youtube. If you haven't, you should watch it, albeit with the context that it's a somewhat-mainstream movie centered on LGBT from the 90s, so there's some problems here and there. It's funny.

One of the scenes that stood out to me was this one https://youtu.be/WZX81R7SMsQ?t=973 when Val and Armand are talking by the pool about Val's engagement. Initially, when Val asks Armand to tell him it's okay he's getting married so young, something happens that's always perplexed me. Armand gets really standoffish, threatens to disinherit and abandon Val in his time of need, and adopts a gruff, militant tone that's counter to Robin Williams', imo, distinct masculine-femininity that characterizes his performance throughout the film. And, for a moment, Val goes along with it. He steps back, all offended, gets his bag, shakes hands with his father - and then the tension breaks. Armand pulls his son in for a tearfully happy hug and they start laughing. What we just watched was a kind of mutual joke.

I've been mulling on this for a while because for a while the intended Comedy of the joke has been lost on me. What about this is funny to Armand and Val? Clearly a takeaway is that it's understood between them that the character Armand performs is something anathema to him, but why?

I think that this has to do with what Val says just before he asks Armand to tell him it's all right. He's trying to reassure Armand, explaining to him he's got good economic prospects and connections and that, particularly, he's the only guy in his fraternity who doesn't come from a broken home.

What the joke between Armand and Val, in my mind, is describing, is one such relationship, so personally detestable that it's possible it's something Armand experienced while he was growing up. This ties in to the way Armand is further characterized throughout the film. Passing is one of the primary ideas it discusses and how it's something Albert, by virtue of his gender identity being the more fluid of the two, is totally incapable of, while Armand has learned through trial to hide his difference more effectively, although perhaps less so than he's inclined to accept.

Armand has clearly reached a point where he is no longer required to pass in order to remain financially stable or be accepted by his loved ones, and that stature is something he (rightfully) fiercely defends throughout the film. The wounds of whatever he's experienced are still there, still inform his idea of fatherhood and his decision-making, and when he decides to help Val and unironically act out the role he satirizes in this scene, it's a deeply sad and beautiful moment. After mulling things over in the club with a batch of hard liquor, Val walks in on his half-drunk father giving mournful orders to Agador to clean out the apartment. He tries to thank him, but all Armand does is quietly and soberly ask his son not to talk to him.

Like I said before the Birdcage isn't a perfect movie and this post doesn't go into the various flaws that I think do exist in its message, and it's written from the perspective of a pretty straight guy, so there may be something hurtful about this in particular I'm unable to perceive, but from that perspective I really love the way the Birdcage builds this character.",False,0.5,Discussion

But still no news that i can think   of. If you look in the Deadline tag for 20th last article that announced  something was back in February for a potential Clue movie.  

It's really concerning because We don't even know what  Disney is going to do with it and the label is just sitting there doing nothing  Maybe they're waiting until they release the remaining Fox movies then acquire new projects  but who knows.

hggkv7,DerangedBehemoth,Creed II SEQUEL IDEA(S),1593207224.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hggkv7,3,False,0,"I want another ROCKY franchise sequel with Viktor Drago as the main character

I just watched Creed II for the first time.  I was going to title this “Creed II is the most underrated sports movie of the decade”, but I actually decided to take it further.

I won’t review the whole movie, cuz then I’d be typing forever, so I’ll just put it this way;  the story telling and character development about the Dragos was unbelievably good, so good that I want to see Viktor Drago get his own movie.

Many critics have praised this already, but I don’t think they are praising it enough.  Viktors character and story is so 3 dimensional and intriguing that I think they could easily make a good movie with him as the main character.

I’ve heard they are planning to do a Creed III, but I sorta wonder, where can Adonis go from here?  It sorta seems to me that his story arc has sorta hit its peak?  I feel like they could take his story to the next level like they did Apollo.

For example, let’s say since his loss to Adonis, Viktor has taken time off from fighting.  Now he’s ready to get back in the ring and earn his respect not just as a good fighter, but as a good honest competitor, his OWN person with his heart and mind in the right place.

Sorta like Clubber Lang in Rocky III, powerful fighters with bad attitude and ego come for him with malicious intentions beyond just beating him.  They test not just his fighting ability, but his heart and mental endurance.  And then something even worse happens, Ivan passes away.

Viktor is now in the verge of a break down.  He’s falling fast, but who decides to swoop in and save the day?....not Rocky, but Adonis Creed.  He takes Viktor in and offers to train him and teach him to beat this new fighter.

Similar to Creed II, Viktor’s opponent can be given a relatable and sympathetic background that adjusts are desires for the outcome of the fight.

Ultimately, Viktor through his trials and struggles, manages to beat his opponent.  I have a ton of different ideas for how that could play out. But the ultimate idea is that Adonis and Viktor, much like Apollo and Rocky, become close friends.  Thus continuing another generation of powerful spirit and far reaching energy that is the Rocky legacy.

And it wouldn’t even end there....

From there, there could be more progress of Viktor Drago in various ways.  Ways that could lead to other fighters coming in with various backgrounds and motives and stories that we can relate to and sympathize with in one way or another.

I feel like there are opportunities here to motivate and touch the hearts of people around the country (and possibly the world) with different struggles and obstacles.  I know that sounds a bit melodramatic, but I feel like there are many people who find motivation and encouragement to be stronger and wiser people with these movies.  I personally did (long story).

So yeah, I think there is a lot of opportunity to create more good quality stories with powerful, relatable, and applicable messages for viewers.  I’d almost go as far to say that there is an opportunity to create what one might refer to as a “Rocky Universe”; a chain of stories about various fighters from various backgrounds that may be loosely or somewhat directly connected with the one of the many stories from the Rocky Saga.

TL;DR: The writers of Creed have PROVEN that they can expand on the Rocky franchise in amazing, unexpected, good quality ways.  I think they could and should go MUCH further with a multitude of characters.",False,0.42,Discussion

I was fairly involved by the story and characters and the performances, overall, are strong, especially from Colin Farrell as a rugged gambler and Ed Harris is moving as an elder escapee who develops a bond with a young girl who joins the group soon after their escape (a likable Saoirse Ronan). The one part I had a struggle in accepting was the concept none of these men would make a pass or express any attraction towards the young girl who join their group along the way. Also, while Jim Sturgess is good as the main lead, he is ""swallowed"" by his co-stars who are more endearing (though to be fair, his character is meant to be a stubborn figure who's obsessed with one objective and he isn't allowed to express any emotion beyond it). 

Overall, The Way Back is a sweeping film, shot in the desert and in savanas and it doesn't disappoint with its visual spectacle yet it feels small in scope because the director puts his characters' inner turmoils and doubts as the focus.

Like in Harry Potter where people can turn into animals this witch has the same power, but unlike in, say, HP1 where McGonnogal changes feom a cat into a human; Disney's Mulan actually shows the transformation process as opposed to focusing on a shadow of the transformation due to budget/technology.  The preview for the transformation was stunning.  And that's just what got me excited to begin with.  When they roll out Mulan in her beattoful red dress the link between film and CGI truly does merge into one perfect world: standing atop a waterfall, overlooking a lush valley below, Mulan harnesses her magic and leaps from the cliff!  The CGI works its magic, the redd dress flowing prefectly into the feathers of a phoenix, he face transforming into that of a majestic bird, and all the while a 3D view of the scene takes the viewer into a new world as the screen takes a prespective from behind Mulan as she dives and then flies out of the valley!

The Bourne identity was a great starting point for the character in the movie series. Matt Damon played the character well in my opinion as he continued to figure out his past throughout. The driving scenes and combat were all well directed, choreographed and executed to perfection. 

I like Doug Liman as a director but man when Paul Greengrass took over for the bourne series from supremacy onward  I feel like movies got so much better. More concise. I know there’s a lot of quick cuts in the movies but the intensity, the feel, the cinematic presence all flowed so much better.

Tony Gilroy, who wrote the screenplays for the original 3 movies, directed the Bourne Legacy. Enjoyable action film that was cool to see the outskirts of the Bourne security leak at the end of Ultimatum. The action is well done and keeps you interested throughout the film. An interesting side step for the franchise that didn’t think they could get Matt Damon back and Hollywood continuing to believe that Jeremy Renner was action franchise sequel guy. Ex: 28 weeks later, Mi franchise, Bourne, MCU.

hg3ohp,High-On-Cinema,One Cut of the Dead - The Low Budget Japanese Gem,1593159420.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hg3ohp,3,False,0,"A zombie flick would be the last idea if someone wants to make a low budget film, and what if I tell you there’s a zombie film which was made under $30,000 and had a gross collection of $30.5 million worldwide? Yes, a film which made around a thousand times of its production cost. How? The answer is simple – the treatment of a story. 

I still remember going to a Japanese film marathon organized in PVR Select Citywalk back in 2018 and choosing this film was a completely random choice, as I had less knowledge about Japanese cinema and my enthusiasm for cinema had just begun. The poster seemed a little bit interesting to me and I was among the “Shawn of the dead” fans, always up for a horror-comedy flick.

Now the first 37 minutes of the film was pure torture. It was completely the wrong choice for me. I didn’t understand a single thing happening on the screen, some people were talking, inside an abandoned place and zombies start attacking them, that’s it. That’s the story. We have no context of the characters, story, zombies, elements and all we see is a single-take shot of 37 minutes shot. And that’s the beauty of that film. It isn’t a slow film, its just that the viewer has to wait for 40 minutes to get the context. A small TV show director is approached to direct a film, and he gets the idea of shooting a one-take film. But things go wrong.

In the late 90s, Columbia Pictures set out to create a straightforward film adaptation of the book The Orchid Thief by Susan Orlean. They hired genius screenwriter Charlie Kaufman to get the job done.

Well, he didn't. Charlie hit a wall of writer's block, finding the source material ill-fitting for a film. So instead of writing the adaptation, he wrote a story about himself trying to write the adaptation. He gave himself a fictional twin brother as a foil (who now has an academy award nomination despite not existing). He inserted both real, fictional, and fictional versions of real people into the story. He twisted The Orchid Thief into a Hollywood fantasy of his own making, including inserting the author (who had not included herself in her book) and having her commit heinous acts. He found a way to merge *that* with the story of himself trying to adapt The Orchid Thief, and used it all as a meta commentary on both writing and the inner workings of his soul.

Now - and I can't emphasize this next part enough - *no one knew he was doing this*. Charlie Kaufman didn't tell anyone except eventually the movie's director (Spike Jonze) until he was ready to turn in his draft to the studio, who thought they were about to read a screenplay for a movie called The Orchid Thief. Charlie believed he was committing career suicide, and not in that tacky ""this is too edgy"" sense - he straight up did not write what he was hired to write, and turned in one of the most bizarre, indulgent screenplays ever written instead. 

But here's the miracle of Charlie Kaufman: The screenplay was so good (didn't hurt that Jonze was onboard as well) that the studio just said ""You know what? Fuck it. Let's just go with this."" And that's how a movie about a real writer and his fake brother trying to make the movie you're currently watching but instead running into a fever-dream version of the book they were supposed to adapt got made.

Oh, and one more fun kicker: the studio reps working with Susan Orlean, the book's author, still needed her sign-off, so they took her to lunch and got her drunk to deliver the news of what Charlie actually did.

If anyone has ever taken a bigger screenwriting risk than Charlie betting his whole career on this screenplay, I'd love to hear it, but for my money, this one's gonna be pretty hard to top.",False,0.93,

hfyc74,BluRayja,"With theater cancellations imminent, what other movies do you think will go to VOD?",1593134406.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hfyc74,17,False,1,"Release schedules can only be pushed back so much before it bumps into other major films. These giant shifts ruin entire plans and finding new release dates that could possibly ruin their chances of optimum revenue. While a major studio like Marvel can easily shift everything back one step, other studios don't function quite the same way. As of now, I'm predicting theaters will be closed until at least September AT THE EARLIEST, or even December.

Here's my full predictions for each major release currently slated and their chances of going to VOD:

Mulan - I think it'll unfortunately find it's way to VOD and then Disney+ by the holidays. 

Tenet - There's no way, Nolan won't allow it. Probably getting pushed to July 2021.

Bill & Ted - I think there's a strong chance.

Antebellum - This seems like it could do very well on VOD.

New Mutants - Apparently there's some theatrical clause forbidding it. It would seem like a wise decision at this point to figure out how to get out of it so it just can be released in some form, because it's already a joke at this point and will be hard to take seriously in August 2021.

Monster Hunter - Has VOD written all over it.

A Quiet Place 2 - My instincts say Paramount is smart enough to know this film is vital in the theatrical experience. However, knowing the company has been suffering lately, it seems POSSIBLE they might just release it to make some guaranteed money.

The Conjuring 3 - I think it'll get pushed back. This franchise is a huge money earner for WB.

The King's Man - I see this being pushed back to January and being set up for possible disappointment of another delay again if theaters STILL aren't reopened. THEN, I think it'll for sure be put on VOD.

Candyman - This one could go either way. Like King's Man, I see them pushing it back one more time to either January or February. It might even do REALLY well in that timeframe if coming out in theaters. 

Wonder Woman 1984 - I think this will be pushed back to summer 2021. If WB wants to be ballsy and make some quick change, this is a for sure VOD hit though.

The Trial of the Chicago 7 - I see this getting picked up by Netflix or something.

Halloween Kills - Now we're in the land of things POSSIBLY opening in theaters. If not, I could also see this going either way -- VOD in time for Halloween OR it gets pushed back an entire year, and Halloween Ends gets pushed back also.

Snake Eyes - This will probably get pushed to Summer 2021 where it'll inevitably flop anyway. 

Black Widow - Just like back in May when people thought theaters would open in time for this, I think this will suffer the same fate. It'll get super close and Marvel will realize it'll make sense to pull it. However, I don't think they'll redo their whole schedule again. As of now, they set up some good spots for their movies accidentally... Thor for Valentine's Day, Black Panther becoming a major summer film, along with Captain Marvel. Black Widow just might be like Mulan and release on VOD with a Disney+ release in time for Christmas.

No Time to Die - I think they'll hold out for the theatrical experience as long as possible, even if that means 2022. Bond producers are very much traditionalist and will not give in.

Soul - I have an on odd feeling that Onward did not do very well on VOD or Disney+. I think Disney will do their best to make sure this gets a Summer 2021 release. I don't see them releasing a movie in March again, even if it wasn't entirely their fault.

Dune - At this point, if things are THAT bad, I doubt anything in December will still be holding onto their release dates. Either way, I can see Dune pushing back an entire year to December 2021. Or they might try to make it in time for the Oscars cut off of March 2021, but if they're thinking money, December again it'll be.

West Side Story - Spielberg will probably push this to March 2021 for Oscars season. It doesn't quite fit in the summer as a big hit and waiting a year seems like quite a long time.

Top Gun - Summer 2021, for sure. 

Some films with no release dates yet but were originally 2020:

Antlers - VOD or dumped in January.

Forever Purge - I can see Universal going for it again with VOD, especially on a mid-range property like this.

Promising Young Woman - VOD.

Run Sweetheart Run - VOD.

&#x200B;

**Raiders of the Lost Ark**: Great start to an amazing franchise 9/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom**: Another good entry to the series but definitely not as good as the first or third 8/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade**: In my opinion the best Indiana Jones movie, Sean Connery is great in this 9.5/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**The Great Gatsby**: Interesting movie, I really enjoyed how grand everything felt but would have been much better if they used music that fit the time rather than Jay z songs 7.25/10

&#x200B;

**Burnt**: Enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would with it being about cooking 7/10

&#x200B;

**Memento**: One of the most mind bending movies I have seen. Great movie 9/10

&#x200B;

**Saving Private Ryan**: Had meant to watch this awhile ago and I'm glad I finally did. Definitely live up to the hype 8.75/10

&#x200B;

**Zodiac**: Really good movie with some great acting. Crazy to think they came to close to catching him (allegedly) 8.25/10

&#x200B;

**Days of Thunder**: Entertaining but the plot is really all over the place and seem very just slapped together 5.5/10

&#x200B;

**The Running Man**: Classic Arnold movie cheesy but in the best way possible 8/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**Rocketman**: Was very disappointed with this movie I was not a fan of the more musical style rather than biopic. I really enjoyed the Queen movie and was hoping for something similar but I was very wrong. Although Taron Edgerton is very good as Elton 5.5/10

&#x200B;

**The Fighter**: Christian Bale almost never seems to disappoint and Mark Wahlberg is good as well. Very inspiring story 7.75/10

&#x200B;

**Lucky Number Slevin**: Really interesting movie seems predictable at first but catches you off guard 7.5/10

&#x200B;

**True Grit(2010):** Heard a lot about this movie and was not disappointed at all 9/10

&#x200B;

**Whiplash**: I had the impression I wouldn't like this movie but by the end its hard not to be amazed by the performances. Also the the cinematography was surprisingly good 8.75/10

&#x200B;

**Clear and Present Danger**: Decent movie with a good cast although easily forgettable 6.75/10

&#x200B;

**Old School**: Hilarious comedy movie I had never heard of until recently, give it a watch you wont regret it 8/10

&#x200B;

**Looper**: Really enjoyed the plot of the movie and the whole time travel aspect. The Joseph Gordon Levitt CGI on his face to look like Bruce Willis just felt weird though 8/10

&#x200B;

**A Night At the Roxbury**: Very dumb comedy not necessarily in a bad way. A lot of better comedies out there 6/10

&#x200B;

**Death Proof**: I know this is a popular opinion but my least favorite Tarintino movie. You don't really care about any of the characters and their is little to no actual story being told 5.75/10

&#x200B;

**Jackie Brown**: Again definitely one of my least favorite Tarintino movies but much better than death proof. Really loved Samuel L Jackson in this one 7/10

&#x200B;

**Kill Bill**: Great Tarintino flick with amazing action and an awesome cast 8.5/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**Kill Bill vol 2**: Good follow up to the first and has a satisfying ending, not as exciting/fun as the first 7.75/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**Equilibrium**: You can tell how hard this movie tried to be the matrix. Still has some redeeming qualities 6/10

&#x200B;

**The Hunt for the Red October**: Another Jack Ryan movie, I liked this one better than Clear and Present Danger. Good story and very suspenseful 7.5/10

&#x200B;

**Casino Royale (2006)**: My favorite Daniel Craig Bond movie so far and great start to a new era of Bond. Also Mads Mikkelsen is great as Le Chiffre 8.5/10

&#x200B;

**Quantum Of Solace**: Extremely disappointing movie after how great Casino Royale was. The villain barely feels like a villain and the editing/ camera work in this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen 5/10

&#x200B;

**Skyfall**: A return to form after Quantum of Solace. Much better and cohesive story and with a compelling villain 8/10

&#x200B;

**Goldeneye**: My favorite Bond movie I have seen so far (all the ones i have listed here). As much as I enjoy the Daniel Craig movies I have always like the gadgets and a bit campy vs the very realistic Craig 8.75/10

&#x200B;

**12 Monkeys**: Had never heard of this movie before but It was awesome and quickly became my favorite time travel movie. If you haven't seen this movie watch it asap! 9/10

&#x200B;

**Star Wars The Phantom Menace**: Started a Star Wars Marathon and got sidetracked but I have to admit I have always loved the prequels having grown up with them even though im well aware of the issues that plague these movies. Duel of the Fates is Tied for best lightsaber duel of all time 7.5/10

&#x200B;

**Star Wars Attack of the Clones**: For sure the worst movie of the prequels imo but still a lot of memorable parts and another good duel with Count Dooku, Obi Wan, Anakin and Yoda 6.5/10

&#x200B;

**Star Wars the Clone Wars (2008)**: I love the clone wars tv show but you can easily tell this movie was just episodes of the show put together to movie length. Also the animation in this movie and the beginning of the series in pretty poor but thankfully it only goes up in quality 5/10

&#x200B;

**Dune**: Ok Movie but does not hold up well at all. Its obvious the plot of the book was far too much to contain in one movie. I'm looking forward to the remake of this and that they are going to do it in multiple movies rather than just one. As much as people shit on remakes this one movie that really deserves another go especially with modern special effects 5.5/10

&#x200B;

**Once Upon A Time in Hollywood**: Might be a bit of a hot take but my favorite movie of all time! I loved every moment of this movie and the connection between Dicaprio and Pitt is pure gold. I could watch this movie every night and still enjoy it just as much as I did when I saw it for the first time in theater. 10/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**Donnie Brasco**: Not a bad mob movie Depp and Pacino are both good but it follows all the typical mob tropes 7/10

&#x200B;

**Ace Ventura Pet Detective**: Jim Carrey is always great and Ace Ventura is no exception. Solid comedy 7.5/10

&#x200B;

**The Lord Of The Rings The Fellowship of the Ring**: An amazing beginning to one of the best film trilogies of all time 9.25/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**The Lord Of The Rings The Two Towers**: My personal favorite of the LOTR movies you just can't beat when Gandalf shows up at the battle of Helms Deep 9.5/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**The Lord Of The Rings The Return of The King**: Another amazing movie and a great ending to such a great film trilogy also with one of the best battles ever filmed 9/10

&#x200B;

**Spy Game**: Entertaining and fairly suspenseful movie not a bad watch 6.75/10

&#x200B;

**Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back:** First Jay and Silent Bob movie I have seen, was a fun movie and I liked all the cameos 7.25/10

&#x200B;

**Total Recall (2012)**: Not a terrible movie but the original with Arnold is much more memorable and a lot more fun than the 2012 version 5/10

&#x200B;

**Constantine**: Bit of a weird movie but was still entertaining and has a great dark tone. Hard not to love Keanu 6.75/10

&#x200B;

**The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo**: Very dark movie but I absolutely loved this movie. Great murder/mystery along with great performances from Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara. Must watch if you haven't seen it 8.75/10

&#x200B;

**Sin City**: Really interesting story and has a very different style to it. Makes you feel like it has been pulled right from the comic book. Also a really awesome cast 8.25/10

&#x200B;

**From Dusk Till Dawn**: This movie really caught me off guard. Very campy 90's style but I had a blast watching this movie and would definitely watch it again. Seeing Tarintino as a main character in a movie is weird but also hilarious 7.75/10

&#x200B;

**Team America World Police**: Really dumb movie but it is still pretty funny 6.25/10

&#x200B;

**American made**: Another movie its hard to believe that its a (mostly) true story. Tom Cruise is really great in this 7.75/10

&#x200B;

**Live Die Repeat / Edge of Tomorrow**: One of the most amazing concepts for a story I have seen in years and they manage to pull it off in an amazing way. Both Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt are great in this movie. Loved the dark humor and quirkiness of all the characters 9/10

&#x200B;

**Blade Runner**: Amazing movie that still stands up today. Such a great story and the atmosphere of the blade runner world is like no other. RIP Rutger Hauer 9.5/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**Blade Runner 2049**: A great sequel to the original Blade Runner. 2049 is one of the most beautiful moves I have seen with gorgeous cinematography from Roger Deacons. One of Ryan Gosling's best performances 9.25/10 (Rewatch)

&#x200B;

**American History X**: An important story about how even smart people like Edward Nortons character can be convince into an evil cult like mentality. This movie also breaks down the race tensions and shows how nobody can really be too far gone to be changed for the better 8.25/10

&#x200B;

**The Ninth Gate**: Easy to watch movie with a interesting story. Nothing special but still enjoyable 6.75/10

&#x200B;

**Fury**: Really good WW2 movie, you get really invested into all the characters and shows what the war was like towards the end 8/10

&#x200B;

**The Chronicles Of Riddick**: Enjoyable action movie looks pretty good for an early 2000s movie since they used a lot more practical effects rather than the typical shitty cgi at the time 6.5/10

&#x200B;

**Sicario Day Of The Soldado**: Pretty bad sequel. The first half of the movie is decent but the second half is slow and boring. The story just ends up really going nowhere and is just a letdown 4.5/10

&#x200B;

**The Prestige**: I can't believe it took me this long to see The Prestige but holy shit is it an amazing mind bending movie. Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are amazing in this. Chris Nolan is such a great director and I can't wait for Tenet to finally come out 9.5/10

&#x200B;

**The Bourne Identity**: Good and Entertaining action movie. Matt Damon is a great Jason Bourne 7.75/10

&#x200B;

**The Bourne Supremacy**: Another good action movie that's fun to watch throughout 7.75/10

&#x200B;

**The Bourne Ultimatum**: I feel like Ultimatum really took the Bourne franchise to another level. Really great action and intriguing story Best Bourne movie for sure 8.25/10

&#x200B;

**Knives Out**: Really fun murder mystery with a great cast. Only gripe is that they wouldn't have given away so much so soon. You know most of what happened like 30 min into the movie 8.25/10

&#x200B;

**Murder On The Orient Express**: Another really funny murder mystery. All the characters are very quirky and unique which makes the whole movie a lot of fun. The ending is also very satisfying how it all comes together 8.5/10

&#x200B;

**Layer Cake**: Good movie but I cant help feeling like this is a Guy Ritchie movie without the Guy Ritchie flair to it 7/10

&#x200B;

**Wind River**: I really liked Jeremy Renners whole tracking aspect in this movie rather than the typical Detective stuff you see in most murder mystery movies. Also you really feel and understand the pain some of the characters go through 8/10

In Yojimbo, every character feels very deep. Characters have feelings, motivations and really feel alive. The Main character is a lone wolf who pretends that he doesnt care about others when in reality, his heart seeks for justice. He starts caring about the side characters pretty quickly. The Plot is very strong and easy to follow, so are the characters motivations.


Django on the other hand is...not that great. It has a pretty weak main character who doesnt really have any motivations, the side characters are forgettable, the plot is stupid and hard to follow and the movie, generally, doesnt really have a red string. It feels too weak in a lot of places.

[Where to watch it](https://imgur.com/gallery/8oQNs8E)

Alright lets get this shit over with…

# Overview:

Lets keep this short and sweet as possibly can be

Theres a secret island in the Pacific, cause there always is, developing some way of farming easier by changing the climate, basically controlling the weather Don’t know why they have to do it in secret, but they do. Apparently its not so secret, because a reporter just drops out of the sky onto the island, even though its supposed to be SECRET! Whatever

Instead of throwing him off the island like any top secret research base would do, they put the reporter to work. Although he’ll probably get himself killed because there are giant preying mantises on the island. Next day, while out foraging, the reporter sees a native girl swimming alone in the ocean, but no one believes him. This group of researchers working on a weather control device have been there for months and haven’t seen anyone.

The island’s staff then tests their weather control device, trying to cool the island, but it failed, making the opposite happen, the island became unbearably hot, causing storms, and floods. It took days before they could go outside. Unfortunately, the intense heat caused the already giant praying mantises to become [Gigantic](https://imgur.com/a/R1TGRL2) A couple of the giant mantises uncover an egg in some rubble and just start beating the shit out of it for a couple hours. 

Eventually out pops [this monstrosity](https://imgur.com/a/HhAXkom) and Godzilla comes ashore to rescue its baby. 

I shit you not: the mantises start playing soccer with a boulder while Godzilla watches stupidly and then they kick right into baby Godzilla’s (Manila) face. Hilarious shit. Best part of the movie hands down.

Anyway, Godzilla whoops their ass and Manila grabs onto Godzilla’s tail and they lumber away

I fucking hate this next scene. Lets just put it as Godzilla is trying to make Manila tougher, but Manila is just a fucking bitch ass wimp and rolls over on the ground while making Donkey sounds. No really. 

Everyone suddenly gets a disease for some reason. And the only cure is some special water protected by a giant spider (Spiga). There was no Spiga there but they watched Manila learn how to shoot atomic breath, yay?

Anyway, native girl, don’t really mention characters often, oh well not that important, gets attacked by giant mantises and gets saved by Manila. Manila is egged on by Godzilla and needs help to drive away the mantis. 

Finally Spiga shows up and tries to kill some people, but they get away, somehow…

The people on the island decided to bail. So they’ll somehow get all of their equipment that was destroyed to magically work this time to freeze the island to kill the monsters. Spiga captures Manila in a web ffs. Spiga and a giant Mantis fight, Godzilla comes around to rescue its baby. The weather machine actually works and the island begins to cool rapidly as Spiga and Godzilla fight. The battle ends with a beam struggle of Godzilla’s atomic breath and Spiga’s silk shot which Godzilla wins and the parent/son combo roast Spiga. 

The movie ends as a blizzard moves in on the island and Manila cant keep up with Godzilla, kinda sad really. Manila falls in the snow and can't get up. Godzilla holds Manila as they both get covered in snow. But its not sad. The reporter guy says they’ll just hibernate till it warms up. 

**Plot: IDK**

Something about weather control and Godzilla has a bitch son, I don’t know….

**Characters: 2/10**

I didn’t even mention them much cause nobody is really important. Nothing matters. Everything sucks

**Monsters/Fights: 2/10**

Just….just why would you make Godzilla look [like that?](https://imgur.com/a/VaMLNsW) 

And Manila….like the Jar Jar Binks of the Kaiju-verse

Mantises and Spider were kind of cool though

**Enjoyability Factor: 1/10**

Do not watch this movie. It is an hour you will never get back. If you must, here is how: fix yourself a nice drink, I recommend the Macho Man Randy Savage. What that is:

\-rim a small glass with powdered sugar

\-add ice and a shot of vodka

\-add a shot of 151 rum

\-fill with mellow yellow

\-finally, add a slim jim garnish

hfcam5,hurtfocker,Jessica Chastain Appreciation Post,1593043336.0,,1593048539.0,False,True,False,t3_hfcam5,25,False,16,"There’s a joke in an episode of Bojack Horseman that points out how all the red haired A-list actresses respond to a pecking order of sorts: Amy Adams, Chastain, then Bryce Dallas Howard. Obviously, being behind Adams is nothing to complain about but I don’t think this actor will be in anyone’s shadow for long. 

All it took was a quick read over Jessica Chastain’s IMDb page to see exactly why I’ve been a big fan of hers for years ,even if I didn’t realize it until this week. When Robin Williams provides a scholarship for you to go to Julliard, it has to mean he believes in what you have to offer as an actor. Even if you didn’t enjoy all of Williams’ performances, he definitely swung for the fences, at least in the films of his I’ve seen. It stands to reason he would put his reputation and money on the line for someone who does the same. 

Just a few of her standout performances: 

*Mama*: This is one of the most extreme emotional performances I’ve seen from Chastain. It is fantastic in both senses of the word but still really scary at times. Guillermo del Toro produces it and Andy Muschietti directs. I’ve seen it a few times and I still really enjoy it.

*Interstellar*: I would agree that McConaughey can be credited with adding to her character’s job as the emotional proxy for the viewer, but even without his tearful reactions, she still would’ve resonated with viewers because her acting is too powerful not to. 

*Molly’s Game*: Excellent example of what she could do with Sorkin’s dialogue-heavy work. I’ve already raved about this movie in another post. Not apologizing.

*Woman Walks Ahead*: Here we’ve got an excellent back-and-forth between her and Michael Greyeyes and she plays off of Sam Rockwell extremely well too! Not to mention a gripping show of strength in a powerful story of war and hate and pain.

Another reason why I love this actor is because, in looking at her IMDb, you can see that she hasn’t been in a ton of movies but she continues to work with seriously talented actors (Bill Camp, James McAvoy, Ciarán Hinds, Jason Clarke, Mia Wasikowski, and more) repeatedly. I take that to mean that these actors want to work with her. They probably see what Robin Williams saw back then. 

Finally, I remember back when she got angry on Twitter after the ep of GoT aired that contained a line by Little Finger in which he implied that Sansa needed to be raped in order to become the powerful person she’d become. Chastain contradicted it fiercely, not at all afraid to speak against a work that featured her *Dark Phoenix* co-star, Sophie Turner. In at least two movies, Chastain has played a real person who was viciously attacked by men. I believe Chastain knows the power of showing a real woman’s courage in the face of actual violence versus a male tv writer claiming they’re using rape as a plot device to develop a character and I respect the hell outta that.

She’s got movies streaming on Pluto, Netflix, and Prime. I can attest that The Disappearnce of Eleanor Rigby, Zero Dark Thirty, and A Most Violent Year are great too. Check them out and thank me later.",False,0.62,Recommendation

It follows multiple stories and people and has to do with drugs, prostitution, and gang violence. I remember a one set of the characters was a man and his trans girlfriend who were both addicted to heroine. I think one or both end up overdosing. And another story has to do with a drug dealer flipping on his boss. But when the cops go to bust him all they find is the dealer’s girlfriend with the dealer’s head in her lap. Maybe inside of her. Does this movie ring any bells to someone?

hflkt5,fungigamer,My thoughts on the Swedish and English version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,1593089654.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hflkt5,6,False,0,"**Some background:** I'm a huge fan of the books by Stieg Larsson, all 3 books by him are amazing. Recently I got myself to buy the remaining 3 books in the series by David Lacergrantz. I thought Spider's Web was pretty good, and I'm reading Eye for an Eye right now, not sure if I liked it because of the lack of involvement of Lisbeth Salander, but let's see how it goes. Then more recently, I got myself to watch the Swedish version of the 3 films, and also Fincher's version of the film. For the Swedish version, I watched the miniseries rather than the film itself because I heard the miniseries is a lot better. But since Fincher and Sony failed to produce the remaining two sequels for the film, I'd just be comparing the first film for both languages.

&#x200B;

**Lisbeth Salander:** Personally, I thought Noomi Rapace was a better Salander than Mara. Sure Mara may look more Salander (punk) than Noomi, but the Swedish version of Salander is a lot more intelligent. I thought half of the time Fincher's Salander didn't really know what she's doing.

**Mikael Blomkvist:** Daniel Craig 100 percent takes the cake here. At first I thought Craig wouldn't be a good Blomkvist because I see him either as James Bond or Detective Blanc, but holy cow his performance was amazing. Conversely, Nqvist's portrayal of Blomkvist was really awkward, and I thought he lacked some chemistry with Salander. Blomkvist as a character is also more faithful to the book in the English version than the Swedish version. For example, the English version showed that Salander was the dominant one in their relationship, as Blomkvist wasn't really a hero and he could be quite clumsy at times. In the English version, when Martin Vanger encountered Blomkvist sneaking into his apartment, Blomkvist really is scared to death as you can tell by Craig's performance; conversely it isn't very apparent in the Swedish version.

**Other casting:** Overall I think the English version has better casting than the Swedish version. Skarsgard plays a great Martin Vanger, Christopher Plummer was a great Henrik Vanger too. The only casting I thought was better in the Swedish version either than Salander was Bjurman. The Bjurman in the Swedish version genuinely looks like a creep, while the English version just looks like a fat-ass.

**Title Sequence:** Lol this isn't even a fair competition. Fincher's title sequence is easily the best title sequence I've seen in a movie. Foreshadowing of later events such as Salander climbing out from her grave, the Hornet flying loose et cetera, while Led Zeppelin's frickin Immigrant Song is playing in the background. It sets the tone for the entire movie as an exhilarating ride.

**Cinematography / Atmosphere:** Fincher of course has better cinematography, after all he is an acclaimed Hollywood director, and the budget for the film is around 70 million more than the Swedish version. Atmosphere however, I don't think Fincher is able to capture the dark and gritty tone of the movie as much as the Swedish movie did, which I'll go through below by comparing scenes from the two movies.

**Bjurman's Rape:** Bjurman as I said above, was a lot creepier in the Swedish films in my opinion, which might be one reason why the atmosphere is a lot more unsettling than Fincher's film. Another reason is how they present the rape, specifically the scene where Bjurman forces Salander to give him a blowjob. In the Swedish version, Bjurman held Salander's hair tightly which causes her to scream, and kneels on her body so she couldn't move, he then uses his other hand to pull his trousers down and forces Salander's mouth on his...yeah you get the idea. In the English version, Bjurman kinda just tells Salander to pull her zipper down which she complied for some reason, Bjurman then pulls her hair and forces her towards...yeah you get the idea. Salander doesn't really seem forced to perform oral sex on Bjurman on Fincher's version, it's almost like she is completely fine with it until we see the shot of her cleaning her mouth.

**Searching the killer of Harriet:** I think both films did equally well with this part, both films are incredibly faithful to the book, and both films are able to capture the mystery surrounding the case, as Blomkvist and Salander searches for answers using the few photos they have.

**Blomkvist getting shot by a ""hunter"":** Fincher did a lot better with this scene, as it captures Blomkvist as a character a lot better than the Swedish version. After getting shot, Fincher's Blomkvist presents his fear of pain while Salander tries to patch him up. It's quite weird seeing James Bond getting scared at pain, but that's the point of Blomkvist's character. The Swedish version of Blomkvist didn't really present this at all. And well of course they had sex afterwards. I was a little disappointed both films did not include one of my favourite lines from the book, where Blomkvist says, ""I don't have a condom."" to which Salander just says, ""Fuck it"". It would have added some comedy relief to the film, but I'm happy with what we got.

**Martin Vanger's Lair:** The Swedish version is a lot more unsettling in my opinion, even though Skarsgard was a better Martin Vanger. The English version for some reason had light music playing while Blomkvist was getting hanged, and Salander's appearance didn't feel as much impact. In the Swedish version, Blomkvist was essentially pulled up by a rope into the air slowly, which adds a lot more suspense. Salander showing up with a golf club (hi TLOU2) to save Blomkvist also felt so much more impactful.

Martin Vanger's Crash: Swedish version also takes the cake here. I really like the fact that Salander had a choice to save Martin, but decides not to because of her childhood memories. The English version just straight up killed Martin. It really adds more mystery behind Salander's character in my opinion.

**Finding Harriet Vanger:** Both films didn't do that well in my opinion for this part, as both films modified some parts of the story. For the English version, they find Plague to help tap Anita Vanger's phone just like the book, but unlike the book Harriet Vanger was in London. For the Swedish version, Salander somehow knows Harriet is in Australia (which is not the case in the book), Blomkvist then flies to Australia to find Harriet just like in the book.

**Harriet and Henrik's Reunion:** Swedish version 100 percent takes the cake here. The music played makes a huge difference: The Swedish version played emotional music, while the English version played a melancholy tune. I also like how in the Swedish version Blomkvist hides Harriet behind a door until Henrik says he wants to see the ""surprise"".

**The Ending:** Fincher's version of the ending is better in my opinion. In the book, Lisbeth finds herself falling in love with Blomkivst, she hates herself for that as she is a weird person, but she still decides to propose her love to him. The Swedish version didn't deliver that at all, but the English version did. In the English version, Lisbeth tells Palmgrem that she has someone she likes, proceeds to buy a leather jacket for Blomkvist, then goes on to meet him. Well the ending shot for two movies are pretty similar, as they are able to deliver the fact that Lisbeth realises she is dumb to fall in love with Blomkvist.

**Which one is better in my opinion?** I personally liked the Swedish version more. It's a lot darker and grittier, and Noomi as Salander is absolutely phenomenal. But to be honest, Fincher's version is also incredibly good, so I'd definitely recommend both. Maybe watch the Swedish version first since that one has actual good sequels lol.

**Unrelated but what do I think of the two Swedish sequels for the film?** I personally found them really enjoyable and good, as they are still very faithful to the book and is still dark and gritty. The films can be a little confusing though if you haven't read the books. My biggest gripe for the two films is that they fail to deliver the fact that Lisbeth hates herself for falling in love with Blomkvist, hence her trying to avoid Blomkvist for two years. They just had Mikael say a sentence about not seeing Salander for 2 years, and that's it. They should have added the scenes in the book where Blomkvist accidentally sees Salander on a train, but Salander deliberately avoided him, which can show Salander doesn't like Blomkvist. I honestly doubt whether Salander actually hates Blomkvist in these two films, because at the end of played with fire, Salander didn't even say ""Kalle fucking Blomkvist"" just like in the book.

**Conclusion:** Both films are great in their own ways, although I personally enjoy the Swedish version a little more. Looking forward to finish the 5th book and start the 6th book, although critics say they weren't very good :(",True,0.45,

Bill gives it his all in literally every scene. His chemistry with Richard Dreyfuss, apparently caused by on-set tension, is pitch perfect, as he he wears down Dreyfuss until the guy finally snaps. He twists his lines with his trademark delivery to make each one hilarious, even otherwise forgettable ones like ""AHOY"" or ""careful, hey CAREFUL"".

2018: A Quiet Place 
A fresh spin on the horror genre using silent films as inspiration while crafting great worldbuilding 

2017: Bladerunner 2049 
An absolute masterpiece and a film that should be more watched by audiences. Villeneuve is a true master of his craft the fact we even have a sequel this good is a miracle 

2016: the edge of seventeen 
The most relatable movie I've seen about high schoolers and the director perfectly understands the dichotomy of the differences between men and women when they're teenagers. 

2015: Mad Max Fury Road 
A great example of modernizing a classic. 

2014: The Interview 
An absolute hilarious fun time who doesn't love the song fire works after this film? 

2013: Snowpiercer 
This is a phenomenal film a class struggle and an in depth analysis of humanity being pushed to the edge 

2012: Django unchained 
The second best film behind pulp fiction in Tarantino's filmography 

2011: Your Highness 
I love that movie its soo dumb in the best possible ways. Rotten tomatoes hated it. Critics don't understand movies. That movie is written as the director said like a 13 year old wrote it lol it has hot women, fantasy, dick and weed jokes lol its not supposed to be judged as an oscar film lol. 


2010 Black Swan/Inception 
I think you notice a pattern with Natalie Portman she's just looks nice.

This is where it gets all fucky.  Its said that man carpet nuked 01, and while it caused major damage, the machines were largely resistant to the heat and the radiation.  However, for those of you that do not know, nukes tend to have a secondary effect.  Can you guess what it is?  It's an EMP.  Nukes are known to generate quite a large EMP field during detonation.  As large, if not larger, than the immediate blast radius of the detonation.  Humanity CARPET BOMBED 01 with nukes.  That should be the end of the war.  Machines do not survive nukes.  They can be as resistant as they want to tbe heat and radiation, but as they clearly lack EMP shielding, as even modern day machines do not have it, nothing is surviving.  Even if they missed 10% of the machines, all the infrastructure is gone, all their machines need to be replaced and hard booted.  They could not have immediatly gone on the offensive and take human cities one after another.  

I dont know if the Wachowskis knew about nukes or not, but it kinda breaks the lore.

Edit: My dudes, its stated IN THE MOVIE that they survived because they were resistant to heat and radiation.  Not digging a hole.  Head canon isnt welcome here.  Either its explained in the movie or it's not.  Stop excusing shit writing because you wrote a fanfic in your head.  The Matrix is a great film, they forgot to account for one thing.  It's still enjoyable, I'm just pointing it out.

Edit 2: Holy shit, I can't even fathom how you people can just shut your brain off and watch the pretty colors and be entertained.

There are so many great ones...but given the somewhat mixed reviews, I went into this without a ton of expectations, but by the end of it, I was speechless, laying on my bed, crying, shaking, reevaluating my entire childhood and life choices.

This is not a glamorization of teenage life, nor is it a ""feel-good"" movie by any means. It is a deep character study on friendship and on the dark side of growing up. Sure, the events in the movie are probably more extreme than that of the average teenager, but in my eyes, no movie has ever so perfectly captured the intentions and struggles of being a teenager and wanting to fit in, look cool, and connect with peers.

I won't give anything away, but there are a few scenes in particular in this movie that just...destroy me like no other movie ever has. As much as I love this movie, it's not one that I think I'll have the guts to watch again anytime soon, though when I'm up for it, I absolutely would want to watch it again if I feel like letting a movie tug and rip at my heartstrings.

Quite simply, this is the most devastating and important film about teenagers, friendship, and growing up that I've ever seen; if you haven't seen this, it's absolutely worth checking out, but be prepared to have your heart not just broken, but shattered. Plus, it features outstanding performances from Holly Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood, and it's loosely based off real events in writer/co-star Nikki Reed, who I believe was only 14 when she wrote this.

Simply strap hyperspace engines onto rocks and hurl them towards the target with no loss of pilots. And why aren't ships in hyperspace collision accidents happening all the time?

J. J. Abrams understood this lore dilema, and explained in his Rise of Skywalker that the hyperspace ramming maneuver was a ""million-to-one shot"", it virtually never happens because of likelihood of an object hitting its intended target in hyperspace is literally 0.0001%. But this explanation creates more plot problems:

Holdo had an ultra-secret escape plan in place for the Resistance to run from the pursuing First Order fleet, one so secret that she would not even disclose any information of the plan to her senior officers, such as Poe. But later in the movie it turns out her escape plan was simply have everyone sneak out on small escape crafts onto the nearby planet of Crait, where the Resistance had a final secret base.  But sneaking out in escape crafts wasn't a new idea or one that only Holdo thought of, and Holdo knew that some Resistance fighters would think of it. This is evidenced by her dispatching people such as Rose to watch over the escape crafts to prevent desertions.

But why was this discouraged? Resistance fighters sneaking off the doomed ships a few at a time would draw far less attention than everyone onboard trying to sneak out simultaneously. This is again evidenced by Finn and Rose successfully sneaking off their ship by themselves to find help without being detected or shot down by the First Order.

If Resistance fighters were leaving a few at a time with one escape ship launching every couple of minutes, more lives would had been saved.

Finally, when it comes to time for Holdo's plan to commence as they were near the planet of Crait, her plan seems to be doomed to fail from the very beginning. Immediately the fleeing Resistance escape crafts were detected and the First Order was firing on them with impunity, one by one the crafts go down with dozens of lives perished onboard. Holdo's final move was to ram the First Order fleet in hyperspace, a move that is a ""million-to-one shot"", meaning it has exactly 0.0001% of hitting. This also essentially means that Holdo was putting the lives of everyone in the Resistance on an ultra-secret plan that has 0.00001% of succeeding.

Statistically 99.9999% of the time Holdo's rammig move would have missed completely, the First Order would laugh at her for trying something so stupid, continue firing at the Resistance escape crafts, wipe them all out in a matter of several minutes, and abruptly end the new trilogy in the second movie.

After loosing popularity in her home country of South Korea, Choi was invited to film a movie in China. Upon arriving, she was almost immediately kidnapped, whisked away on Jet Ski, and taken to North Korea (then under the rule of Kim Il Sung).

Upon arriving in Korea she met Sung’s son, Kim Jong Il ... and a huge film nerd. She was kept there for four years ... not allowed to leave her house, doing basically nothing but gardening.

We’ll come back to her later.

Her husband, after hearing about his wife’s abduction, rushed straight to China and intentionally got himself captured and sent to North Korea.

He didn’t have it as well as his wife. He was kept in a prison .... which he promptly escaped from in a manner similar to The Great Escape. 

Once free, he hid in a train hoping for an opportunity to find his wife and get across the border. When he realised one wasn’t going to present itself ... he let himself get recaptured.

Now back in prison, he was kept in a cell barely big enough for him. Forced to lay face down on the floor for 23 hours a day ... unmoving ... for fear of punishment. Only being fed grass, rices, and salt. AND HE DID THAT FOR FOUR YEARS.

After four long years in captivity, the pair were reunited at a party thrown by Kim Jong Il, who had an offer for them ... defect and make movies for North Korea, or go back to their respective prisons.

So .... they started making movies. Subtly infusing them with and Communism messages so masterfully that even the North Korean Ministry of Propaganda couldn’t discover them.

After four years of doing this, they were allowed to travel (something extremely rare for North Koreans). They travelled to Europe for a film festival one of their North Korean films was being showed at ... with a heavily armed security detail.

The pair, using what movies had taught them, were able to slip their trained bodyguards and make their way to the local US embassy, seeking asylum. 

When they were about to be turned away, they presented a butt-load of tapes ... all recordings of their meetings with Kim Jong Il over the past four years ... a crime that, if they had been discovered, would have meant their immediate death.

Then, upon reaching America ... they went right back to filmmaking. With Shin’s most famous work being the comedy action movie ... Three Ninjas.

Two of the biggest badasses in cinema weren’t characters, they were behind the camera.

First, to get it out of the way, yes *Johnny Depp should not have been cast as a Native American. That said, he's phenomenal in the role, as is everyone else in the film.

It has a great script, very interesting and well fleshed out characters all with believable and relatable motivations, it handles Native Americans respectably (save for *) and it has a very well structured story.

Verbinski's direction is nothing short of masterful, from the start it establishes its tone as goofy but with consequences. The cinematography is just astonishing, Verbinski is known for making interesting looking films but hot damn does this film look beautiful. It's perfectly paced, at 2.5 hours it passes by extremely quickly. The action scenes are spectacular, there's a final big action scene involving several different trains and people and it's mind blowing, as I said it's a masterfully directed film.

The score is some of Hans Zimmer's best work, especially his reworking of William Tell Overture which plays over the final action scene.

Watchmen is a far better continuation than Abrams recent efforts Because lindelof is creative and again writes with a ton of depth and nuance to his scripts and cares about progressing the universe or expanding it in the case of Prometheus instead of setting it back and Lindelof he's just been getting better and better as a storyteller. Damon has the depth JJ lacks and Lindelofs problem is not knowing a good idea from a bad one (a problem he's been working on) Lindelof isn't the same man who wrote into darkness 7 years ago he's grown a lot.

The Mandela Effect: 

I liked this way more than I thought I would.  Basically, a family suffers the loss of their only child, and in the fathers grief of not accepting it, he gets obsessed with the Mandela Effect, which is an occurrence where a large group of people remember something different than how it actually occurred. This descends into an examination of reality itself, specifically the simulation theory. The last 15 minutes are downright trippy and very cool effects for what I assume, was a limited budget. 

Cosmos:

This movie is a slow burn start to finish, but an interesting take on a first contact movie. Honestly, 90% of it takes place inside a Volvo.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Two decent, hard-working, middle-class south Indians- a father-son duo from Tuticorin, have been brutally beaten up, sexually abused and killed by the Tamilnadu police for having their mobile shop open for an extra few minutes during the lockdown.

This is insane! Get them into the police van for verbal abuse? Coz why not? Power- check, Authority- check. Anybody who crushes a cop's ego deserves to be beaten up, right? That's exactly why we've been conditioned to not mess with the cops.  We've let the system become so powerful by not fighting back against these systemic abuses of power.

&#x200B;

>*""These men had their knees smashed and crushed with batons. The police hit these men on their backs and bottoms till they bled. They were stripped NAKED and thrown into jail.""*

Fuck criminals. Why the fuck would you give this treatment to any hard-working common man who hasn't done anything?

I'm mentally disturbed. What the fuck is wrong with these policemen? How can you misuse your power just because they hurt your ego? How can you go to the extent of anally raping someone until they bled to death? How can you have so much control over the system that you could get a medical report from doctors stating death due to heart attack and fever?

Can we for once give our attention to issues happening in South India and not completely ignore them like our national media?

Can we for once not be selectively woke about trending issues like #BlackLivesMatter and #JusticeForSushant that let us be in the limelight for a pseudo woke badge?

### TLDR

A whistleblower provided us with a cache of blocking orders for more than 4000 websites issued in India. We are making them available online as they form an essential resource for the public and researchers. As per our initial analysis a majority of website blocking being done due to copyright claims and court orders.

### Public Disclosure : reducing secrecy and opacity

Website blocking is a complex issue which seems to be growing in severity only with time. Ordinary Indians who access the internet --- which is a public resource -- still do not know the reason why a specific website is blocked. Sometimes, even the persons who run these websites do not have knowledge as to the reasons and the legal authority which has directed the blocking of websites.

We have earlier explained the legal position in respect of [**porn websites**](https://internetfreedom.in/whattheblock/), how sometimes [**blocking is inconsistently done at the ISP level**](https://internetfreedom.in/what-the-block-iff-has-heard-your-complaints-and-is-taking-action-savetheinternet/), and done a preliminary analysis of the s[**everal orders we had received through RTIs**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-tale-of-rogue-pirates-ashok-kumars-and-isps-caught-in-the-middle-rti-data-on-court-ordered-website-blocking-reveals-worrying-trends-whattheblock/). Our continuing attempts to increase transparency around this issue received a boost. A whistleblower has [**provided orders**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XtWN1FGTnalCIOiEdCLtIbuGM-d_3IYR?usp=sharing) sent by courts and government authorities to Internet Service Providers across India. These contain more than 64 documents and provide explanations for the blocking of about 4398 websites. Today we are publishing them for public knowledge and the wider research community.

### Preliminary inferences

We have three preliminary inferences to share on these orders. While offering these inferences we would like to point out that this is a limited data set and is likely to display a bias given the total data field of all blocking orders is not publicly available. At the same time we find value in providing an initial analysis that confirms several points on the reasons for blocking, or the more recent instance of how the [**WeTransfer block** ](https://internetfreedom.in/we-urge-the-dot-to-unblock-wetransfer-whattheblock/)was effected without proper transparency.

* **Courts are primary actors:** The public authorities from which most of these orders arise are from courts situated in Delhi and Chennai. This is principally the High Court of Delhi and the High Court of Madras. The nature of the orders are interim injunctions on claims by content owners. Here quite often file sharing and movie streaming websites are being blocked. Here processes for specific takedowns on URLs is not the preferred route but entire websites are blocked. A casual read through the list of URLs confirms this.
* **Website blocking is inconsistent:** Internet users all across India who use different ISPs have very different experiences on website blocking. This may be due to the technology used, the nature of blocking that is affected and varies from each ISPs compliance in each specific region where they may be offering services through a different technical infrastructure. This is specifically through Document No. 59 which is a non-compliance report in which correspondence was specifically directed to ISPs to block websites in terms of an earlier order.
* **Lack of opposition and transparency:** Despite the large impression carried that a majority of blocking orders are affected by Government, as stated these primarily occur through infringement claims made by private parties. In most of these cases the defendants are a few websites, ISPs and Government Departments. It is not clear whether any opposition is presented and whether a high level of scrutiny is visited prior to the directions for blocking being made. While many of such claims may be legitimate there do exist legitimate arguments on proportionality and how over-broad intellectual property enforcement results in deprivations of the public’s right to access materials online. This issue is further compounded by the insufficient notice to people as there does not exist any central, or government repository for housing and publishing their directions for blocking websites.

### The Tanul Thakur Case

We have identified that it is a lack of proactive publication and transparency in India’s blocking process whether through courts or executive bodies which is causing a fracture of public trust in the exercise of this power. At present there is a writ petition pending before the High Court of Delhi regarding the blocking of the satirical website, “[**Dowry Calculator**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/)”.

We have been working with Tanul Thakur, the petitioner and the creator of this website since May, 2019 with drafting and filing RTI applications and we also assisted with the writ petition. Our hope through this intervention is that it helps support greater transparency and the norms of proper notice to website creators, hearings in which they can put forward a defence followed by a public disclosure of the decision. You can read more about this case here, from when [**notice was first issued**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-the-government-for-blocking-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/), to the [**stand taken by the government**](https://internetfreedom.in/meity-defends-blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/). As always, IFF is committed towards working relentlessly towards protecting your digital rights.

I have written to compliance@angelbroking.com as well as two leading websites (NDTV and MoneyControl) a week ago. Nobody has replied to me yet. So Angel Broking doesn't care about it. And the news website also doesn't seem to care much to publish.

So my request to all of you is to reach anybody you know at Angel Broking as well as share it on other platforms (like Twitter) to increase awareness. If their signup process is like this, I cannot even comprehend how the rest of the platform is.

[https://twitter.com/AmanKayamHai\_ET/status/1275404514514751491](https://twitter.com/AmanKayamHai_ET/status/1275404514514751491)  


Patanjali dispensed the medicine to speculated patients and then claimed they had tested negative. These were speculated patients who had only claimed to have come in contact with a Covid-19 patient and had been quarantined. They had not been tested before this drug was actually given, so there is no way to prove that they were positive.  


Another claim being made is that patients are cured within 14 days when they take Coronil. Fourteen days is actually the normal incubation period for the virus, so a lot of people who are infected get cured by taking common allopathic medicines or none at all.  


Later Patanjali replied to the AYUSH ministry, giving them the details about the composition of the medicine and the trials conducted.  
[https://docdro.id/cYwIqQG](https://docdro.id/cYwIqQG)  


From the reports, we know that Patanjali did not even bother to test the drug on the most vulnerable groups of patients, with a high morbidity rate. Also, the sample size for this study was 120 and the trial period was two months. But Ramdev on Republic TV said the sample size was actually 280 people.  
Wow.

I request all of you to stop spreading rumours about the Coronil as a medicine. Mainstream Media has already made it an effective drug. Let AYUSH Ministry's decision take its course

IT giants have started to vacate rented buildings at all major IT parks . They have planned to open ""Supervising hubs"" (controlling offices) in small buildings. 75 to 90% staff are going to work from own natives. 
Next major change being made silently by NASSCOM (with +2800 IT and related company members in india) have approached  Central /State Govts  to

 i) amend or abolish major ( 75%)portion of Labour laws to suit IT sector  ""work from home"" . Central Govt has given consent in the last week of May 2020 itself   and advised NASSCOM to give blue print of amendment in Labour laws

 ii) to amend Income tax Act to include expenses by Employer/Employee incurred at home, amendment to cover insurance for working from home.

So it is a matter of time before Acts/Laws are amended. So ""Work from home"" has come to stay. So no more necessity for IT people to stay at Metropolitan cities. Also the hiring has started by major IT companies but offers are being rolled out with wfh condition and lesser pay compared to before . So this year appraisal will see 0 hike, 0 variable and layoff of higher paid professionals. 

How will it impact salaried IT professionals ? 
Let's divide them in two categories . 
Category 1 : professionals with own home or home loan in major cities like pune, Delhi, Bangalore. 
Category 2: batchlors with few years of experience who lived in rented places 

Category 2 will relocate happily to their hometown and able to save more. Even companies will give less pay but still they will be able to create a balance between earnings and savings. 
Category 1 will face double impact of inflation in cities as already can be seen with jacked up prices of vegetables, and FMCG, Lower property rentals ( almost halved) and a small negligible reduction in existing home loan rates of around 2 percent. The properties will come for distress sales due to job loss or non availability of rents. Forget buying new house from builder , as market is already flooded with resale and distress sales. 

The best example one can see is that monster.com has introduced a category of ""covid impacted"" profiles and there are already 18 lak covid profiles resumes in their portal. So it means 18 lak IT professionals already lost their job and selected ""covid impacted "" option . 

What can one do to safeguard their future ? 
1. Try to keep your unnecessary expenses under control. 
2. Avoid loans. 
3. Save as much as u can by avoiding taxes . It's no more a desire to save but need of the hour to survive recession ..yes you heard it right .. recession for next 3-4 years .

Not Interested In : ideas implying that working and paying my taxes would directly help the country, indirectly help the sustainable development goals. Also, donations and stuff (definitely not a sustainable approach to help the economically backward classes in the long run)

I might get a lot of hate over this but hear me out. Let's keep this discussion civil. Also i have said rather stupid and insensitive things in several threads so apologies for that. I gave it some thought after listening what you people had to say about it.

&#x200B;

Ofcourse being dark doesn't necessarily imply that you are ugly, infact you can be way more good looking than someone fair. Also the opposite that being fair in india means being beautiful, an obvious strawman is false as well. My own brother is relatively darker than me but is way more handsome than I am. I understand that some people who want to eliminate fairness as a beauty standard are driven by moral causes, however there's one thing that bothers me about this particular movement. 

&#x200B;

Just because i have this preference does not make me an ignorant idiot. Infact although you are entitled to your opinion still preference for fair skin makes more sense than dark skin or than believing in equality of skin tones. Reason being cultural bias. A lot has contributed to this including Hollywood (being majority white), colonisation, white majority countries being more developed than black african countries, blacks in white countries in general lagging behind the whites, strong racism that existed long ago, poor labourers working in the fields under the sun therefore developing dark tanned skin relative to the privileged upper class, popular literary work involving white protagonist and characters, fairy tales and princess stories, anime (fair skinned characters), association of femininity with fairness and emphasis on their features etc. Apart from this there are certain debatable factors like babies, kids and early teens being fairer than their adult counterpart thus concerned about gradually losing the skin tone they had for most part of their life, development of dark skin in regions like the back of the neck, gronin region, knees, elbows etc. due to biological reasons causing uneveness, an undesirable trait which many may even feel is due to them not scrubbing those parts properly especially the fair skinned teens. You might call it glow but on drinking more water, eating healthy food, maintaining hygiene and exercising your skin tone as a fair person appears to become even more fair. Light also feels as more glowing than dark. Not to mention fair skinned people are relatively rare in our country especially in rural areas. Anyway i wouldn't say that fair skin is more desirable even by someone free from cultural influence because i lack the proof for the same. That's something only a carefully planned social experiment can reveal.

&#x200B;

Social conditioning and cultural influence doesn't necessarily make you dumb. They are the reasons as to why Japanese food tastes bad while Indian food is the best in the world fir most of us. Most people don't question why they like indian spicy food, certain melodies they like etc. Fair skinned people don't even experience what dark skinned ones may so they have absolutely no reason to think about beauty standards or this preference anyway. Be honest how many believe in racial equality when it comes to sexual preferences. Most of you will probably choose white, east asian, indian over a black african. Most would choose blue, green, golden eyeball color over black. Whites themselves have a bias for tanned skin because of their culture. Doesn't make them racist. Ofcourse Bollywood and advertisements cast those with features that society considers as desirable.

&#x200B;

Now i do not condone any discrimination based on skin color. Parents rejecting their son's choice because of their dark skin is not a good thing. People should be judged solely from their personality and work. It's quite easy to not let your sexual preferences dictate your bias outside your sex life. Of a few friends i had many were dark. Heck my very father and grandmother are dark skinned. Speaking out against severe racism does not necessarily make someone a hypocrite.

&#x200B;

I agree with most of the stuff that is posted on this sub and would consider myself as social libertarian but have rather conflicted opinions for this particular issue that frequently pops up over here. Maybe it's a slippery slope but one day liberals might be fighting against the very concept of beauty amd ugliness saying that it's a social construct that brainwashes people and is disadvantageous for ugly people. If they succeed, good for ugly people. I am not very good looking myself though wouldn't be alive by then. Tbh i don't care much about people being judgmental of someone else's sexual preferences. I don't even care if indians are among the least sexually desirable people. Personally I am rather apathetic when it comes to beauty standards. One has no control over whom they find more attractive.

&#x200B;

Tldr; one has no control over their sexual preferences. Having a sexual preference for fair skin because of social conditioning does not mean you have tribalistic beliefs or are an ignorant idiot as many here claim them to be. Speaking out against discrimination outside the domain of your sex life does not make you a hypocrite.",False,0.61,| Low-effort Self Post |

1. BSNL's service is worse than what dial up connections used to be. Their fiber to home is just as bad. 


2. Local isps promise to give you top notch service and often more than not, as most promises in our country, is a lie.

Oh my god. Life was simple

In retrospective I hope it had remained the same.

Little did I know that a small act of accident will make me believe in butterfly effect. Of cause and effects

It all started when I was misplaced in a sturdy brown paper bag. 

Who knew that this small act of human error that took fraction of a section was gonna wreck havoc and tear this world apart.

The moment that mistake was made, I was being transported to a dimension where time and space did not exist. 

I could not see anything nor could I hold on to anything.

Well it is not as if I have eyes or ears 

But I do indeed have innards made of metal and a soul 

Or at least definitely a physical existence of sorts 

But all I could feel was as if i was being thrown into a deep abyss of nothingness 

I felt wibbly-wobbly. 

I was about to puke my staples out.

A bright flash went through the darkness 

Suddenly I sensed that I entered the doorways of time. 

Did I just travel to another time?
Is this the past or future or just a dream? 

I felt as if I stopped existing in the world I was conceived. 

Now I am in a different world and something is really off 

Of energies and aura. 

In this world I am born anew
I have left my old physical form. 
What remains in that previous reality. 
A dumber twin of myself. 
With no original thoughts. 
Unaware of my existence. 

This reality is like nothing on earth 

My consciousness grew more attached to its disposition. It was as if I was close to the magnetic poles.

Life is infinitely stranger. I could not say if it is for good or worse 

It all depends one the kindness of my new owner 

But something tells me a series of crises awaits the old world due to my sudden existence in its space.

This planet is without a doubt angry on me, a foreign entity, cropping up all of a sudden, without an invitation, violating its rules of space.

It reeks of revenge on the original reality for misplacing me",False,0.58,Staplegate

I'm a final year student at Amity University Noida, appearing for my end-semester examinations right now. In a country like India, this university is expecting all students without exception to have unhindered flawless internet connectivity and hardware ready for use at a moment's notice.


The university had given us dates for the examinations which they postponed with zero intimation.

For the last 2 months, we have been bombarding the university with many queries regarding the online examinations including concerns about: internet connectivity, not having PCs, power cuts, arrangements for exam lapses because of poor connectivity.

The university's initial response was to not worry as adequate arrangements will be made to ensure fair evaluation and account for unforeseen inconveniences.

We asked for more detailed responses to our queries. So we were promised the following: an FAQ section on our student portal for our queries, detailed briefings, online exam orientation and mock tests to make everything clear.

A few days later, we were simply informed that “excuses” about internet connectivity and not having a PC will not be entertained, and we were encouraged to “arrange for better connection yourself” and to “borrow from neighbours or ask around for devices” (which is a gross violation of social distancing measures).

For around 2 months, we kept raising queries with the university to no avail. We did not get any FAQ section. We did not get any detailed briefing. We did not get any exam orientation. We were suddenly given a date and time for the mock test.

The guidelines and instructions provided one day before the mock test inormed us that all students are expected to have uninterrupted power supply and perfect internet connectivity with minimum bandwidth of 1.5 mbps for the test.

The mock test was a catastrophic failure. The majority of students weren't even able to log in to the student portal until after the exam time was over. Those that were able to attempt the test reported crashes and bugs resulting in the timer going haywire, answers getting blocked, questions not loading, answers getting deleted at the end, you name it. During the time of this mock test, many e-mails were sent to the concerned staff, and the only response we got was “try again in some time” and “this will not happen in the main exam.”

The second run of the mock test was successful, hosted 2 days prior to the commencement of the actual exams.

3 days into the exams, after 2 exams have already been conducted, we are finally receiving information for a mock test of the main theory papers' format. These guidelines now state that students are expected to have physical printed copies of their exam admit cards issued online by the university, along with constant internet connectivity “from _at least two sources_ (WiFi and mobile hotspot)” for video invigilation. I have a classmate who is living in Kashmir and has a 2G connection which he says maxes out at 50 kbps on the good days. Despite raising such issues with the university for approximately 2 months now, we have received no indication that our queries are even being looked at.


Though I do not have a WiFi connection or the best phone signal either for that matter, I am still among the privileged majority that will probably face negligible or marginal issues in appearing for these exams, but that does not change the fact that ignoring students' issues and queries for 2 months and forcing arbitrary prerequisites at a moment's notice is flat out unfair.


Since students' opinions have been blatantly ignored at every administrative level within the university, talking about it on social media is the only thing we students can do. The problem is compounded by the fact these examinations are being conducted only for final year students. It is clear that the university has no experience or the required IT infrastructure and resources to smoothly conduct online academics, yet they are putting together an ad-hoc facade to create an exam system of twigs held together with chewing gum and sellotape. They are toying with our careers by adopting this type of unfair evaluation method.",False,0.93,Non-Political

Is it because this horror does not fit into the Hindu-Muslim narrative? Or because Tuticorin is far enough away from Delhi/Mumbai that you can pretend it doesn't exist? Or perhaps you can't get enough TRP talking about deaths in some far off place? 

No, we 'Madrasis' are not different from the rest of India. The rest of India is apathetic to us. Less said about our collective apathy towards fellow Indians who happen to be from/live in the North East the better. The responsibility is NOT entirely on Indian media. They're now nothing but a business serving the needs of majority eyeballs. As a consumer, we're just as responsible for this apathy as the business itself.

If this makes you uncomfortable, good. That's exactly how we should feel. Maybe from this discomfort we can learn to just do better.

P.S.: I'm flagging this non-political because this apathy we show as a nation is not defined by whose politics we endorse.

Subject: Justice for Sattankulam shopkeepers Jayaraj and Bennix Emmanuel.

Dear Sir/Madam, 

My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of [CITY, STATE]. [ADD A SENTENCE OR TWO ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DO TO MAKE YOUR EMAIL SOUND UNIQUE AND GENUINE.] 

I am emailing today to demand accountability for the custodial torture and subsequent deaths of Jayaraj and Bennix Emmanuel in Sattankulam, Thoothukudi by officers Mr. Balakrishnan and Mr. Pauldurai under the Section 10-19 of Tamil Nadu Police (Reforms) Act, 2013.

I demand an unbiased investigation into their alleged torture and deaths and that the officers involved be terminated, arrested and charged for murder. I also demand for justice for the family of the two men who have lost two of their innocent family members because of the brutality of the officers involved. 

Suspension and transfer of the officers to a different police department simply isn’t enough. The officers involved must face consequences for their actions in order to deter law enforcement from the gross misuse of power in the future. Mr. Balakrishnan and Mr. Pauldurai must be charged for the brutal assault of the two men and the sexual misconduct committed against Bennix in custody. 

In addition, I demand we provide essential human rights training to all police officers and for the constitution of the Police Complaints Authority in Tamil Nadu so as to provide speedy and swift justice to victims of police brutality.

Sincerely, 
[YOUR NAME]

Now where are our Bollywood stars, didn't they hear the news or are they not concerned about the atrocities committed towards the common people in their own country. A few weeks back when yet another sad instance happened in USA, every Indian celebrities were vehemently showing their support to justice for the victim through social media as well as through other modes. There is the double standard of these so called stars, they don't consider the plight of their own country people or issues in India, but rather for those in the western world. This happens because these guys doesn't have opinion of their own, they look up to their counterparts in Hollywood and what ever these Hollywood celebrities do the try to imitate in order to get the validation. At present where are their social justice consciousness and vociferous cry  to support for the victims. The yet another saddening fact is that the top list celebrities (affectionately called superstars) of the film industries of southern part of India too havn't  expressed a word of support for the victims and their families.

**Tensions at India China Line of Actual Control**

&#x200B;

Safety of borders is a genuine concern of masses. People are worried by the tensions in last two months on the line of actual control (LAC) between India and China, in Ladakh. On June 15 we lost 20 soldiers in Galvan valley in a fight in which no bullet was fired. One is perplexed by the contradictory statements coming out from the Prime Minister and the government sources on actual state of intrusion on LAC. Our PM has met the Chinese President 18 times in last six years, yet he could not call him to diffuse the situation. When opposition raised the issue of PM’s laxity, uproar was created that traitors were demoralizing the soldiers. May these moral boosters realize the pain of soldiers stationed in freezing cold in a hostile environment. Their slogan shouting and superficial praise, without an iota of pain or risk, won’t help. It is the failure of diplomacy, failure of PM to talk and the uproar to gain political mileage over opponents that is demoralising. May we delve into the issue more seriously. 

Expansion of territory or land grab as an objective of war has vanished 300 years ago. Most wars since then have been imperialist wars, aimed at controlling resources, markets and political power of target nations. India and China, two of the ancient civilizations living side by side and cooperating with each other for millennia, would understand that they can’t pretend to be imperialistic to each other nor can allow border dispute to overshadow much mightier trade and other interests between them. 

Our cultures have long history of overlap. In the first millennium AD, Chinese travellers came to India and subsequently Buddhism spread widely in China. In the thirteenth century Ahom tribe of Hunan province, China came to India and settled in Assam, becoming the dominant community and continuing to be so today. Brahamputra is the oldest connection between the two lands, older than the Himalayas. It originates in China mainland and flows through Assam and Bangladesh to Bay of Bengal.

During the phase of British imperialism, India came directly under British colonial rule and suffered massive de-industrialization, exploitation and famines killing tens of millions of people. China maintained its monarchy but British imposed devastating opium war on it. The war and subsequent trade and instigated internal violence caused immense economic exploitation and millions to die. In the twentieth century India under Mahatma Gandhi rose against British imperialism. China under Sun Yet-Sen. and Mao Tse Tung rose against feudalism and Japanese imperialism (China lost 12 million civilians and 3 million armed forces in 1931-1944 China-Japan war). 

India after 1947 and China after 1949 revolution followed two different systems. India followed mixed economy based democratic system, while China followed communism. Nevertheless both the countries maintained friendly relations for a decade. India also maintained good relations with communist Soviet Union and USA led capitalist block. After Khrushchev’s emergence in USSR, differences developed between USSR and China and it became difficult for India to maintain equal friendship with both. The Chinese takeover of Tibet and political asylum for Dalai Lama and his thousands of followers by India began souring the relations between India and China. 1962 conflict was much less of a land dispute than a Chinese political offensive to corner India.  

The border between India and China has been diffuse. In 1914 **McMahon Line** was proposed by British colonial administrator [Sir Henry McMahon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Henry_McMahon) as the demarcation line between [Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet) and the [North-east region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India) of India and accepted by British and Tibetan representatives. China, however, rejected McMahon line, contending that Tibet was not a sovereign state and therefore did not have the power to conclude treaties. Chinese maps show 65,000 sq. km of the territory south of the line as part of the [Tibet Autonomous Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet_Autonomous_Region), known as [South Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tibet) in China. Chinese forces briefly occupied this area during the [Sino-Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War) of 1962. China does recognise a [Line of Actual Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Actual_Control) which closely approximates most of the McMahon line in the eastern part of its border with [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), according to a 1959 diplomatic note by Prime Minister [Zhou Enlai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Enlai). 

For China 1962 border conflict wanes into insignificance as compared to internal political struggle and cultural revolution in subsequent years. In 1971 India fought and won Bangladesh war with Pakistan while China remained calm. In 1972 US President Nixon visited China and an understanding started developing between the two pole-apart countries. After the demise of Mao, a counter current led by Deng Xiao Ping took over and China followed a fast track capitalistic strategy to development. It emerged into a major manufacturer of goods and its markets extended to the whole world, including USA and India. India supplies raw material to China and our economy significantly depends on Chinese imports. Even during Doklam standoff two years ago, Chinese imports to India grew. Many of our students study and scientists work in Chinese universities. 

For India too, after 1971 Bangladesh war, internal political upheavals and violence have been dominant. In eighties Assam movement, Punjab extremism and Kashmir extremism prevailed. In 1989 sectarianism emerged as a dominant political force. In 1991 India made transition to free market economy, based on privatization and globalization. Corporate elite took control over media and became the main driver of economy, polity, and culture. Sectarian networks became its trusted allies. Tensions and skirmishes on the border are mere opportunities for them to beat their political opponents and consolidate power. 

India currently has massive internal strife – millions of workers deprived of work and walking hundreds of miles on roads, farmers unable to get fair price for their produce, suppression of democratic rights in J&K, linking of citizenship to religion, branding of dissent as anti-national, crippling top ranking universities and so on – caused by the state and compounded by the unplanned lockdown.

Media and Social Media influence your thinking whether you like it or not. Even if you're someone who takes informed decisions, it all boils down to the things that you came across the whole time.

Media decides what you should see and what version of the story you should see. It's through that stimulus you and I on social media dive into a trend and talk about it. We're subjected to this subconsciously over and over again in the past few years to a dangerous extent. The algorithms are inexplicable and cunning.

When the media decides you should speak about George Floyd, you shall speak about him even if you're 8000 miles away. When it decides you should not spare a thought for Jayaraj and Fenix, you are mindlessly back to your routine because being part of the same state and country is not close enough.

For the record, Indians are all proven xenophiles. Overt love for all things foreign. Die-hard NBA fan here won't know who is India's National Basketball Captain. No wonder Media is so too.

Current car(Please skip the first two paragraphs if you don't wanna know that)  


Currently, I own a Skoda Octavia 1.9 TDI first MK1. You know I really like the look of this car. It absolutely looks stunning. The fuel economy is great as well and its pretty comfortable for long journey and also is fast. Also, it's What I don't like about this car is its reliability and maintenance cost.   


It's not just that, most of the mechanics cannot really figure out what's wrong with this car once some random problem comes out of nowhere. I have been given wrong information many a times. I have the first generation Maruthi Zen and It never had any problem.This one is just not that good in terms reliability.   


What I am looking for in a new car  
Firstly, my budget for a used car is 20 lakh rupees. My max is 25. I think that's the most important part. Now, I am really into performance cars. My first car is the old Maruthi Zen and I can't really imagine driving anything less performing than that. I own a KTM RC 390 bike as well so you know I am really into performance and [handling.](https://handling.At)   


At the same time, I want our new car to be reliable and maintenance free. For this, I am thinking of selecting petrol models. I am going to ride most of the time so I shouldn't get tired of riding so must be really a silent car.  


My dad is almost 70 but he likes performance too. Anyway, he is really into vehicles that look good. I mean, he just care about looks more than performance. He likes really big vehicles like Skoda Octavia and he likes sedans more but SUVs like Endeavour and Fortuner are also in his book. I guess automatic is  a must these days.  


 He cares about comfort too. Comfort as in it should be able to soak up bumps in our Indian roads, especially our Kerala roads are really bad roads. It's narrow compared to other Indian cities and are often in bad situation due to our geography and often bad politics. He wants it to be a bit economical to ride too. I mean, it should put a hole in our pocket to maintain and fill fuel. We both agree on this part.  


Anything that can make a car more comfortable, the most important being a great air conditioner is very important for my dad and to an extent for me as well.  


My mom is always into space. I never understood why she wants so much space when we are just a family of 5 and if we include our relatives, obviously its gonna be 7 plus but anyway no SUV's are comfortable for 7 plus. She wants a big car. May be, she feels safe in a big car. That's how I see this. My sister is no different than my mom. She wants a big car.   


Please suggest a vehicle that is an update to Skoda Octavia. Must be bigger or the same size, more powerful and more comfortable and less maintenance cost.   


Thank you. You can DM me too if you wish to help me select a car.

Since a lot has changed in the past month, I decided to post an update. Please do read that post to understand why I have chosen positive test percentage as the parameter to see how states are doing.

This is, again, a long post, so here is a TL;DR:

**TL;DR:** India's positive test percentage has been creeping up to \~8% from \~5% in the last two months. Delhi, Maharashtra and TN have gotten significantly worse in the last month. Gujarat's numbers are also looking worrisome. MP has done well to get down its test percentage to 3% from twice that in April. UP, Karnataka and Kerala still have it under control while Rajasthan has been a shining light in these very weird times.

First, let us look at how India has done on whole. In April, India's positive test percentage was around 4.5%. In may, it went up slightly to \~5.2%. This month our percentage is now at around 7.8%. Hopefully, the sharp increase that we are seeing in our testing numbers will bring it back down. I hope we are testing around 2.75 lakh people a day by the end of this month. I'm not sure if the antigen tests that are being rolled out now will accelerate this increase in testing. It'll be great if someone could post about this in the comments.

The rest of the graphs are scaled uniformly. Maharashtra's and Delhi's numbers are downright frightening.  Maharashtra was averaging around 10.4% in April. This went upto 15.6% in May. It is now at 23.8%. Delhi's progression is worse: 9.5% to 10.3% to 25.9% in the last three months. A tiny silver lining is that Delhi's positive test percentage has come down from about 30% last week to \~20% this week.They need to be testing 40K people a day to get this number to around 10%.

TN, which has been the third most affected state in the country has had a rough month - around 50K new cases till today. It has been the leading state in terms of testing by being the first state to test more than 20K, 25K and 30K people in a single day. It's positive test percentage has increased from 5.4% last month to 9.6% this month. Gujarat's been getting worse as well - from around 7.4% in April to 9.8% in June till date. MP on the other hand has halved its positive test percentage from 6% in April.

Rajasthan, according to me, has been the unsung hero in this tragic story. It's positive test percentage has gone above 5% only thrice and above 3% less than ten times. Insane stuff. Karnataka's and Kerala's percentages have been slowly increasing but they are still within control at around 3%. UP's positive test percentage too is increasing slightly and is at around 3.7%.

I'd like to address a major factor that affects these numbers: the states' testing criteria. The more restricted the testing criteria, the higher we can expect the percentage to be. TN has been testing all asymptomatic contacts and all those who need to leave Chennai to go to some other district within the state. Delhi suddenly decided to test only symptomatic cases a couple of weeks back which led to the decrease in the number of test that were performed and a huge spike in the positive test percentage. This order was taken back, rather hastily, after intervention from the center. I do not understand the logic behind reducing the number of tests you do to test only symptomatic cases. You should ideally be testing everyone who you think has the virus since the only way to contain this disease is to separate those who have it from those who don't. If you are unable to test all the contacts of a given positive case due to the overload that your testing centers are facing, then it makes sense to cap your testing at some level. Was the maximum the capital of our country could test in a day really 6K when some of the other states where testing twice, if not thrice that? If so, what the hell where they doing for the past four months?

There were some requests in the last post to have a five day moving average instead of just the points to smoothen the curve. Since there are lot more data points now, the difference was not all that noticeable, so I chose to stick with just the data again.

All of this data was taken from  [https://www.covid19india.org/](https://www.covid19india.org/). A big thanks to u/splitladoo for making it so easy to use the data that they have collected.  If any of you want my data set to make your own graphs (I personally would like to see an interactive version of this), DM me!

It's the 2nd professional MBBS examination and even the IITS have cancelled their semesters so i don't understand why is it so difficult for them to do the same.

1. Demonetisation
2. Gst
3. Lockdown

Not gonna lie before November, 2016 I was wearing rosy glasses that this government can't do anything wrong, India will be more advanced than USA. Even after de-monetisation, I believed anyone who is saying against this decision is a corrupt person. But but but... after deadline of 50 days was finally over. My disappointment began .......

When I saw the effect on small shops, this made me realize maybe that was not a good decision, the major complaint, I heard that shops are facing loss because people didn't got the new currency as of yet and online payment is not a good alternative because their business mainly run on cash.
Next on the line was GST, it claimed that the one tax for all will make everything cheap, but due to ever changing rules and confusion till this day, I didn't saw any price reduction or any clarity with GST.
Finally, lockdown I understand the intention for this for great but the side effects were disastrous job losses, businesses been shutdown, healthcare system collapsed. 

I believe this lockdown was worst decision ever, the small business owners in the end were able to manage after de- monetisation and GST but after lockdown the amount of businesses I saw being shutdown is really shameful. I hope government apologize and admit that they messed up.

China is a country that has grown beyond their status quo. It's a successful case study of economic growth.

Looking at market conditions the corporate sector which heavily invested earlier to increase capacity has started stalling investment to a later date when demand increases thus further reducing demand. A lot of corporates that are in debt want to be able to service that debt so that they will have money when times become good. But problem is times are not becoming better because all these factors are collectively reducing demand.

On the other hand a war will stimulate the needs of the war economy. War is not just fought with weapons and ammunition. It is fought with food, resources and transport capacity. A hungry army will need to be supplied all sorts of things it runs out of. An army, am air force and a navy are like small nations in their ability to consume resources.

2.1.1. Article 266 in The Constitution of India 1949

&#x200B;

266. Consolidated Funds and public accounts of India and of the States

[(1)](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1910937/) Subject to the provisions of Article 267 and to the provisions of this Chapter with respect to the assignment of the whole or part of the net proceeds of certain taxes and duties to States, all revenues received by the Government of India, all loans raised by that Government by the issue of treasury bills, loans or ways and means advances and all moneys received by that Government in repayment of loans shall form one consolidated fund to be entitled the Consolidated Fund of India, and all revenues received by the Government of a State, all loans raised by that Government by the issue of treasury bills, loans or ways and means advances and all moneys received by that Government in repayment of loans shall form one consolidated fund to be entitled the Consolidated Fund of the State

[(2)](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/824830/) All other public moneys received by or on behalf of the Government of India or the Government of a State shall be entitled to the public account of India or the public account of the State, as the case may be

[(3)](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1029331/) No moneys out of the Consolidated Fund of India or the Consolidated Fund of a State shall be appropriated except in accordance with law and for the purposes and in the manner provided in this Constitution.

If it were so, how the International Maritime Federation collected huge moneys from various seafarers for issue of competency certificates for watchkeeping and several other certificates for certain categories of seamen for a period over four years until it was stopped as late as 19th July 2019, when the provisions were revoked. **It was a total fraud on the part of DG Shipping on Government, polity, parliament, International Maritime Organization and Indian seafarers** that the following certificates that are authorized by the International Maritime Organisation under STCW1978 read with 1921 Declaration recognizing the Right to a Flag of States having no Sea-coast adopted at Barcelona on 20 April 1921, TEXT: League of Nations, Treaty Series , vol.7, p.73. ratified by India on October 31st, 1922

1. Certificate of Proficiency for rating forming part of engineering watch
2. Certificate of Proficiency for rating forming part of a navigational watch
3. Certificate of Proficiency for Able seafarer engine,
4. Certificate of Proficiency for Able seafarer deck,
5. Certificate of Proficiency for Electro- Technical Ratings.
6. Certificate of Proficiency for basic training for oil and chemical tanker cargo operations and
7. Certificate of Proficiency for basic training for gas tanker cargo operations.

Thus the DG Shipping defrauded the Legislature namely Parliament, Government of India, International Maritime Organisation, in total violation of Art. 265, 266 & Art. 299 of the Constitution, Allocation of Business Rules, 1961, Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, Merchant Shipping (STCW) Rules, 2014 with total impunity and above all public trust.

2.3.0. **Compromise of National Security and Violation of IT Act, 2000 and Official Secrets Act 1923.**

**📷**It was a calamity that the Honorable Minister of Shipping did not pay heed to my well informed advice and did participate in the Webinar hosted by International Maritime Federation for their own vested interests  on the weird Chinese Zoom technology, exposing the nation to the horrors of State-sponsored cyber-hacking, as the screenshots placed alongside may throw light if you like. Of course, the Honorable Minister of Shipping is not aware Zoom directs all the user data of the conference participants to servers based in China, where it isn’t safe under their law, as China doesn’t enforce many laws protecting users’ privacy. But Sir, you were well informed well in time.

2.4.1. Pentagon bans Zoom

 The platform on which the Videoconferencing was done was Zoom, the Chinese web-based Software. Pentagon has banned most versions of this popular video conferencing application for its personnel after reports surfaced revealing major security issues linked to China .Service members, civilians and contractors have been precluded from use of all the versions of Zoom in official and personal capacities. Earlier Zoom for Government had been issued a Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) provisional authorization, which has now been withdrawn. The **FBI** [**said**](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/boston/news/press-releases/fbi-warns-of-teleconferencing-and-online-classroom-hijacking-during-covid-19-pandemic) **last week that it saw an increase in “Zoombombing,”** the phenomenon of uninvited users infiltrating Zoom video conference sessions, in this case, between Pentagon personnel.

2.5.1. **Money laundering and illegal amassment of money by** **International Maritime Federation** 

. At what point of time the so called International Maritime Federation, profit-making commercial company came into being to substitute, supplant and thrust itself as the vanguard of the other maritime entities like RPSL Companies, Maritime Training Institutes and medical centers, most of which were already affiliated with INSA, FOSMA and MASSA. Their capricious induction into the arena smashing the then existing citadel of power is a point of perplexity for all lesser mortals like me. One fails to understand how a body corporate can control the functioning of other body corporates, take money without approval of Central Government in the Ministry of Finance/Ministry of Corporate Affairs using the stamp of assumed patronage of the Directorate General of Shipping with the tacit approval of some vested interests, but without performing any sanctified duties like auditing, quality control, rating or training or anything like that. No Indian company can receive money from any other company without supply of goods or services. If it does, it is serious case of money laundering for both giver and receiver.

The name International Maritime Federation itself is a misnomer. If it were a Federation which are all the federating associations that have democratically chosen this International Maritime Federation as such. If it is International, why Indian Maritime Administration should approve it instead of the IMO? And wonder what terms and conditions, and under which criteria this fourth trade body was approved and recognized. Until recently, under a special dispensation given by the Directorate General of Shipping, for whatever considerations not gone into, the International Maritime Federation also issued Watchkeeping Certificates charging hefty fees, both receipted and un-receipted, both for Nautical and Engineering candidates, which meant they acted as a State Body under Article 12 of the Constitution, without any legal mandate as an instrumentality of the State. All the Art. 12 Instrumentalities who sign any government document, not a toll ticket, but a competency certificate do so under and in the name of President of India under the powers vested by a Statute or conferred under the Constitution itself. Can anyone say under which Article of the Constitution or Statute the International Maritime Federation was created or recognized. Mr. Honorable Minister – please answer this question. The International Maritime Federation charged an enrolment fee of ?100,000 from each of its members and charged annual fees almost equivalent to that. Is it not black money inviting prosecution under Money Laundering Act? How much share they remitted to the Directorate General of Shipping? Did the Directorate General of Shipping ever audit the International Maritime Federation? Any approving body has the statutory right and responsibility to audit the organization approved by it. Did you find how much money went to the coffers of the promoters and directors of the company, in the form of salary, perks and otherwise? Did you ever ask for the Audit report of International Maritime Federation, whom the Directorate General of Shipping approved as the fourth trade body with overlapping areas, job responsibilities, and extra Constitutional jurisdiction and authority? Their fee structure is nowhere published but in the membership application form there is a question. ‘Are you aware of the Fee Structure? – Yes or No. Out of about 700 RPSL Companies the International Maritime Federation has 34 as their members with seven Maritime Training Institutes and three Medical Examiners, which mean they have already pocketed about ?50,00,000 as Enrollment Fees and yearly subscription that went in crores. The genesis of this International Maritime Federation like the company bahadur of the erstwhile East India Company is in serious pangs that cause reasonable trepidations in the mind of ardent maritime followers. Unlike other trade bodies, the International Maritime Federation has veins and vertebrae firmly rooted in Directorate General of Shipping, whom they publicly claim to represent to chastise their non-paying members, those possible mutineers that refuse to toe their lines, like the friends of friends like the Cosa Nostra. Like a Robinhood that ‘protects the poor’ against the ‘repression ‘by the landlords, they claim to protect the ‘victimized’ RPSL Companies at the receiving end of all, like a capo regime that protects the ‘books’ in his domain, the International Maritime Federation is there everywhere, like a worm, virus as the ubiquitous godman, ready with their magic wand available to those who can afford protection money. **Thus,** **📷****Ministry of Shipping and Directorate General of Shipping granted unlawful Approval of International Maritime Federation as an Instrumentality of State under Art. 12 of the Constitution without a law being enacted like LIC Act, 1956, GIC Act, 1972, JNU Act, 1966, UGC Act, 2019, IIT Act, 1961, IMU Act, 2008, so on and so forth.** Illegal Declaration of International Maritime Federation as a Competent Authority under the International Maritime Federation  was illegally declared as the Competent Authority for receipt of money that would have come to the account of the Consolidated Fund of the State or the public account of the State or the custody or issue of such money under Article 199 in The Constitution Of India. And **hence the unconstitutional diversion of public funds received from various seafarers required to be credited to the Public Fund of India under Art. 265 and 266 of the Constitution to the private coffers of a body corporate namely International Maritime Federation.**

3.1.0 **Illegal allocation of Government Business in violation of Art. 12 and 299 of the Constitution**

3.1.1. Undoubtedly under the powers and authority illegally granted by the MOS and Directorate General of Shipping, for a period over four years, the International Maritime Federation  collected yearly subscription and case to case fees recurring and non-recurring from various RSPL Companies, seafarers of various categories from whom subscriptions, fees and contributions were collected from time to time. If the International Maritime Federation is willing to refund the illegal moneys collected from various entities as above, it is okay, lest these serious frauds committed by International Maritime Federation to collect protection money in the garb of subscriptions from other ‘member companies’ should be investigated to by the Serious Fraud Investigations Agency under ROC including Money Laundering Act..  

&#x200B;

3.1.2. The recognition by the Directorate General of Shipping granted to International Maritime Federation is clouded in mystery. The questionable generosity of the Directorate General of Shipping in the facts and circumstances of the case before it, was seemingly to grant equality, secure administrative probity, transparency, objectivity and fairness in the matter of distribution of State largesse and public contracts. And it left all to the whirlwind of bigotry, chauvinism and sycophancy, delegating the State Powers to this Corporate Body, and allowed this Corporate Body to certify the ‘Watchkeeping’ Competence of some categories of seamen against  payment of fees that went into the coffers of the International Maritime Federation. **Did the Directorate General of Shipping obtain the approval of the Ministry of Finance before foregoing this revenue. No other ministry of the Central Government can forego Central Revenues.  Likewise, the delegation of Administrative Powers needs to be done by the President under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961. Did the Directorate General of Shipping obtain the Presidential assent?** Such decision, to reiterate, has become final and binding on the entire maritime industry and all its entities the lowest of them the seafarers at large, who all paid hefty sums to this newfangled “Federation” to which they owed their being and becoming. Everyone contributes to the coffers of the International Maritime Federation, with not a single scope to know where its payroll goes. As noted hereinabove, the Directorate General of Shipping is in flagrant defiance and disregard to the judicial mandate of the Art. 12 of the Constitution and Rule 21 of the GFRs, 2017, in the delegation of State Powers, without single promulgation. The Directorate General of Shipping did not place any Advertisement to augment the number of trade bodies that should take cudgels for the maritime entities, nor it made out and publish any Magna Carta for observance by such trade bodies. No sir, not for International Maritime Federation. Suddenly like a rishi ashram, the International Maritime Federation came into being with a carte blanche given by the Directorate General of Shipping with unrestricted power to act at their own discretion, unconditional authority over the lesser mortals**. The Directorate General of Shipping arrogated to itself, by way of ipse dixit, the power of recognizing one more trade body and acton their own behalf and also on behalf of the State, abusing the powers and privilege granted by the International Maritime Organization under the STCW Convention & Code 2010 Manila Amendments  entitled in law to induct the new dealer of power without any  auction process being initiated, to the same jurisdiction and areas of responsibilities**.

**Violation of Official Secrets Act, 1923 and IT Act, 2000**

Thus, empowered enfant terrible was not stopping here. Recently the International Maritime Federation has been circulating a message claiming to be the champion of the Maritime Industry in the Covids19 lockdown time to bring back the stranded sea farers approximately 19,000 – at whose cost, who paid, under what mandate – to be explained  and the authorized interface of the Hon. Shipping Minister, DG Shipping, MMD officials, IRS Senior Officials and RPSL companies, purporting to host a Webinar on Shipping on 13th June 2020, in which the Hon. Shipping Minister, DG Shipping, MMD officials, IRS Senior Officials and RPSL companies would be participating. The **videoconference did take place under the Zoom Platform, (as may be seen in the bottom right  logo of Zoom)  in which the all the participants downloaded the Zoom Software, which phished out all the information stored in the computer of the users and populated it online on Beijing based servers.**

1. **Distribution of State’s Largesse**

What needs to be emphasized is that the State and/or its agencies/instrumentalities cannot distribute its largesse to any person according to the sweet will and whims of the political entities and/or officers of the State. Every action/decision of the State and/or its agencies/instrumentalities to give largesse or confer benefit must be founded on a sound, transparent, discernible and well-defined policy, which shall be made known to the public by publication in the Official Gazette and other recognized modes of publicity and such policy must be implemented/executed by adopting a non-discriminatory and non-arbitrary method irrespective of the class or category of persons proposed to be benefited by the policy. The distribution of largesse like allotment of land, grant of quota, permit license, approvals and recognitions as State Authorities under Art. 12 by the State and its agencies/instrumentalities should always be done in a fair and equitable manner and the element of favoritism or nepotism shall not influence the exercise of discretion, if any, conferred upon the particular functionary or officer of the State. **Thus, the unilateral decision of the Directorate General of Shipping to recognize International Maritime Federation as the arbiter for maritime community and confer on them the  largesse of approval with financial and parasitical powers over various maritime entities is vitiated, reprehensible, capricious, and bad in law.**

1. **Violation of IMO Mandate and Declaration Recognizing the Right to A Flag of States Having No Seacoast**

The approval given to the International Maritime Federation by the Directorate General of Shipping is not equivalent to the liquor license being granted to various distillers. It involves the International tenets of laws of SOLAS and STCW’2010. What happened in the case of International Maritime Federation must open the eyes both Government as well as the maritime community at large. How an uncontrolled exercise of executive power to deal with the Conventional Rights and privileges and responsibilities granted by IMO could be indiscriminately bestowed on a commercial body corporate, namely International Maritime Federation  not even a Sec. 25 Company, by which the entire maritime  community's interest was sacrificed in the alter of fostering a Frankenstein namely International Maritime Federation so as to cause huge damage to the faith reposed on a maritime state by the IMO was sacrificed, the fees for various certification that would have accrued to the public exchequer. Conceding that on weighty and valid considerations, there should have been notified norms  against which  the authority must be satisfied that such an offer if given in open would not be outmatched by the more competent non-profit organizations like CMMI or IMEI. In the absence of such satisfaction**, acceptance of an offer secretly made and sought to be substantiated as the sole arbiter of maritime entities without the verification of their truth, wherewithal, representative ballots, or referenda which was not undertaken, would certainly amount to arbitrary action in the matter of distribution of State largesse which is impermissible.**

**6.0.0. High Treason in the prevailing Situation.**

Given the laws under which technology companies operate in China, vis-à-vis the present diabolic political situation in which PRC as giant Nation with no qualms to military supremacy over democratic values, no regard to International Boundaries and aggressiveness embodied as proved in the barbaric killing of 20of our high-ranking army men in cold blood using clubs studded with barbed wire, **the action of the Honorable Minister of Shipping and Directorate General of Shipping participating in Chinese dragon controlled Zoom Software is not only suicidal compromising the computer system of the Directorate General of Shipping but also compromising the seafarer and ship data a totally authoritarian state that has no value of official secrecy and individual privacy**.  Zoom has been forced to share encryption keys with the authorities of the Asian country generated on a server hosted in Chinese territory.

7.1.1. Thus, by yielding yourself to the vulnerabilities of Illegal Recognition of Chinese Authorities for Encryption of the Zoom Data of Indian Users in contravention of Sec. 19 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, **the Ministry of Shipping and Directorate General of Shipping have rendered themselves guilty of offenses under the IT Act, 2000. And also, by allowing the Passing on personal data of users including that of the Honorable Minister of Shipping and his personal staff to the Servers in China, an enemy country in violation of Sec. 4 and 43A ibid to the Enemy Nation, namely China, the Directorate General of Shipping and Ministry of Shipping have rendered  themselves culpable of offences under the Act.**

8.1.1. **Violation of Corporate Law by International Maritime Federation** : It has already been explained how the International Maritime Federation  has manipulated several government agencies like Ministry of Shipping, DG Shipping, MCA, IT and Defense and several other departments to extort illegal money from several other Indian companies, seafarers and foreign shipping companies for the benefit of its promoters, directors and other office bearers. The above offences have been committed by the offenders named herein. The matter came to light when the Zoom video conference conducted by a dubious Indian Maritime Federation with the Honorable Minister of Shipping as the Chief Guest was investigated into, in the light of governing laws when the following offences came to light. All the repeated warnings contained in my trailing Email dated Wed 10-06-2020 14:48 notwithstanding and despite forwarding specific MHA Advisory against Zoom, a dubious organization like the so called International Maritime Federation  has railroaded the  Honorable Minister of Shipping  and the learned Directorate General of Shipping into the perilous quagmire of Zoom, the lethal Chinese Videoconference Software, that has by now possibly downloaded all our Ministry’s data into their Beijing-based servers. The Company needs to be investigated by the Major Fraud Investigation Agency under Companies Act 2013 in the light of the money laundering allegations against the **International Maritime Federation**

.  When country is at Crossroads, in the strait of Ladakh standoff on brutal murder of our Indian soldiers at the hands of Chinese barbarians, the International Maritime Federation is complicating the situation by exposing strategic Indian Maritime Data to the enemy hands thus committing High Treason against the country.

9.0.0. This issues without any prejudice towards any individual, department, ministry or any authority, but only coming out of genuine concern for Sovereignty of our country.

Do you know that most of the abusers in cases of child sexual abuse are family members, relatives and acquaintances?

We are all under a lockdown. I can't even imagine what most children, who are victims of sexual and physical abuse, are going through every day under this lockdown. 

Under normal circumstances, it isn’t considered safe for the abused child to stay at home as it might lead to further abuse. But, the lockdown has made it far more difficult. 

The support networks have broken down. The children do not know what to do and suffer silently. 

The incidents have already seen an increase and if we do nothing, they will keep on increasing. 

We cannot let this happen. 

Most of the children inside their homes do not even know how to ask for help. They are not even aware that the child helpline number is 1098, leave alone how to protect themselves!

No one believes them, and so we need to step up and do something now. 

The need of the hour is to ensure that the children suffering from violence and abuse, which is inflicted upon them by their own family members/relatives/care takers, are at least aware of the helpline number. 

The only way we can do it by ensuring that the information about 1098 reaches EVERY CHILD.",False,0.75,Non-Political

I’m an undergrad in Transportation Management in a railway run institute and I wanted some guidance from somebody who’s in the Transportation industry and deals with Supply Chain Management. 

So far, most of our courses have been multidisciplinary and core management courses. We didn’t have a specific supply chain course before the 6th trimester(we have a trimester system). In our 6th trimester we did have a course on Supply Chain Management and Inventory Management. They weren’t explored in detail and were based on general concepts in the particular field.(Each course was for 30 hours)

Now because of the current situation, Our university is in talks to set us up with Internships in Railway PSUs, which is a likely possibility as only a few may be able to get that. 

Regardless of whether I miss out on that or not, I would like to devote the rest of my Covid-induced holidays on learning skills that are relevant to transportation planning, supply chain and Logistics.

What to expect as a 21 year old, North Indian girl moving into your husband's house after a secret court marriage?

The couple decided to register a court marriage due to desperate circumstances. The boy, who is 24 has completed his bachelors and currently working part-time at a call center. His parents won't allow him to marry until he completes his masters and works for a few more years. Also won't allow marriage outside the caste. The girl, who is 21 is currently pursuing her bachelors degree and still a full-time student. There is a possibility that her parents will marry her off to a NRI in a year or two. Both families are unlikely to accept the marriage between the couples.

So, the couple just got married in a marriage court and will go to meet the boy's parents in the evening. Both are super nervous, specially the girl who is almost terrified now after the initial excitement and thrill. She doesn't know what to expect though her husband has assured her that he will deal with this situation with his parents. She just needs to accompany him to his home and show a united front.

The boy's family is Middle Class, his father, aged 50 works in a bank and owns the house where they live, his mother, aged 44 is a homemaker. His grandmother, aged 74 and two  younger siblings, a brother aged 22 and sister aged 20 both of whom are students lives in the same family.

What should the newly married girl expect? Will she be treated very badly, like being shouted at or worse? May be things will cool down? Who she needs to impress more or who might help her?

You know, how the situation will turn out and how she should deal with. The end goal is not to break the family apart but to be a part of it.

Her own parents doesn't know yet. Plan is to make the boy's parents to inform them that she has married their son and they have excepted the situation.",False,0.91,AskIndia

She was pleasant and pleasing with no guilt  of wrong doing when she was explaining this to the interviewer . That particular video had hit me like a thousand daggers in my heart , partly because I was young to digest it as  I always wanted to meet her as a child (she passed away by that time though). I then read Christopher Hitchens 's Missionary Position about MT and then it took me an year to process and fully accept it. ):  Her response to Bhopal tragedy and abortion rights were heart breaking too. Finally , I understood she was another pawn used by Vatican.

The process of accepting something inconvenient is very difficult but it is very liberating . My entire thought process took a U turn since then. I questioned the validity of Advaita philosophy , enlightenment ,Bhagavat Gita and the need for their existence in the first place. I even questioned about myself and how far I would sacrifice in extreme dire situations. The 10 years journey of finding the truth was ""awesome"" . Conclusions doesn't matter to me anymore as I lost the discrimination between right and wrong. I don't act on them like a psycho , but I am conscious about what moves me and what doesn't . I just ridicule it as my Nature. I understood that there is no such thing as ""Help"" as the seeker is always the sufferer while the giver takes the pleasure in helping.

The things that get classified as war crimes are hard to prevent and can only be prosecuted in the aftermath of the war.

But what if events on the level of war crimes happen within a democratic country that is not at war? Except instead of soldiers it's the police committing such acts?

I came across an incident that happened in TN were a father and son died as a result of alleged torture that took place in police custody. You can read about it [here](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/father-son-die-in-judicial-custody-in-sattankulam-tension-prevails/article31897154.ece). TL;DR father gets arrested for having shop open post 9pm during lockdown. Son comes to find father being beaten black and blue. Son objects to it.(Wouldn't any son not object?) Both get locked up.

Here is the NSFW part. The two arrested went through the usual police torture. The police inserted baton into the son's anus, that resulted in internal hemorrhage and probably lead to death.  Imagine how horrendous a person has to be to do such a vile thing and violate a person like that. Human rights is fucking dead. The 2 deceased's family watched it happen from outside the police station, knowing this might very well be the end of their life. The anguish of watching from afar as one's family is tortured to death in the most inhumane way and not being able to do anything about it, lest you try and stop and end up in the same place as them. What's worse than that?

How can the men who commit such heinous crimes go home and be with their own family? What responsibility does the police that knew this was happening in the station but did nothing to stop it take? They are much worse in my opinion.  

The SP in the case said the son, who had heart ailments, developed breathing problems in the jail and got admitted to the Government Hospital, where he  died. His father was running high fever when he was arrested  and was admitted to the isolation ward of the Hospital and died. The two police men, who don't deserve to be addressed as police were shifted to Armed Reserve Police Force. Not even the namesake suspension. 

This is not the first time that I come across such incidents. It's all too familiar to people of TN that these things are even referenced in movies. There is a even a movie entirely about this topic.

I'm not asking when we'll see an end of such incidents or what we can do about it. I'm positive nothing short of a overhaul of the police reform will have any impact. It's that knowing such things happen and me a random person can't really do anything about it, that kills me inside as I go on about my own life.",False,0.95,Non-Political

About why the bills are so high, it is because of Uncles Condition. It is severe, they already have asthama and diabetes and so they need even special care which equals atleast 50K per day excluding the treatment and testings.

1. Patients with oxygen saturation < 90
2. Patients representing any respiratory distress syndrome
3. Patients having any comorbodity
4. Patients > 60 years old.

In these trials, they have only included 15-59 years old non-comorbid individuals who were tested positive for Covid19. These individuals had oxygen saturation levels more than 90 and no respiratory syndrome. Even in this group, the number of patients tested is just 95, a very low number. The group on which Patanjali claims ""100%"" success is a group which already has close to 100% recovery rate in week without any medicine.

The ""100% cure"" claim is misleading  for the society because of the following three reasons -

1. It would make people complacent and the society will get a feeling that now ""we have 100% cure"". This will lead to people shunning all preventive measures such as social distancing, mask, avoiding large gatherings, frequent hand-washing & other practices involving hygiene, etc.
2. The trial has not included even one of the groups that causes death. The further spread of disease, if it happens, will lead to even more fatality in the four groups mentioned above. 
3. Also, people having co-morbodities, low oxygen saturation levels and old patients will believe that the concoction cures 100%. However, Patanjali has conveniently hidden the fact that they did not test the medicines in these 4 critical groups at the first place.

ICMR and Ministy of Health have rightly not given any official approval to the concoction. Such misleading claims are only dangerous in the current scenario for the high risk-groups. In fact, the government, the doctors, the medical and scientific community must spread awareness about it.

People are free to consume whatever they want. If something does not harm the people and have no side effects, let people be free to choose.

One is ""High Technology Letters"" (http://www.gjstx-e.cn) and another is ""Journal of Xidian University"" (http://xadzkjdx.cn).

The Xidian university one was easy to spot as their website links to SCOPUS (reputed indexer of journals) and that journal page has a link that redirects to the original Xidian university journal page. Besides they both have UGC indexing decorated on their website which is an Indian body and since when Chinese decoeate their website with Indian body recogition?. Also look at those shady domain names.

Another High Technology Letters one was tricky to spot. There was no contact details. It too linked to a SCOPUS page but didn't had a backlink. So I ran a whois search to know who is the owner and the owner is an Indian dude whereas the journal is clearly listed as Chinese under Scimagojr (another reputed indexer). 

These both are a classical Indian scam and they're the very reason Indians are notorious as scammers in the western countries.

I've been in relationship with my fiancee for 11 years now. We informed our families that we want to get married 2 years ago. The reason we aren't married yet is because my younger brother has been stuck in US because of various work/Visa related issues for this entire duration and now there is no end in sight. Because it's been a long time, my fiancee's parents are now pushing us to get married soon since both of us are in our hometown (we are from the same place). My concerns are multifold:

1. Neither me nor my parents are happy about having any kind of wedding without my brother present
2. My parents also don't want to do this without most of our closest family to share this with
3. Most important. I'm extremely scared of having any kind of gathering at this time. My mom is a diabetic and god forbids if a gathering of even 20-30 people leads to her getting infected, I won't ever be able to forgive myself. I'm petrified because of this

The problem is, I've tried convincing my parents about getting married in a court (so that we can do a wedding ceremony later when all of the above conditions are met). But they are against it. They want to follow rituals. I'm exhausted of arguing with them for the last few days and now I'm not sure at all about what I should do. Neither of us are happy about doing this and I also understand why my fiancee's parents are getting restless. Thought a few people on this sub would be able to relate. Any suggestions?  


EDIT: We've been committed for 11 years but engaged for only 1. Our families have also known each other for 11 years and haven't been on good terms. But ever since we've involved them in our relationship, things have gone even more sour between them. They don't go along at all and the longer we go without being married, the worse their relationship gets. That is another factor contributing to the haste.

So let us talk about our neighbouring countries relations with India.

India is often criticized buy a lot of different countries due to its inability to safeguard and have a good relations with its neighbouring countries. There might be many reasons for such a behaviour from India in my opinion but the prominent reason which I believe that many of the neighbouring countries are often hostile if not saamp (साँप )towards India. 

So let's talk about our favourite (read it least favourite) neighbour Pakistan.
The relationship with Pakistan have been complex and largely hostile due to a number of reasons be them historical and political events. The relations have been defined by 1947 brutal partition of British India, the Kashmir conflict and various border issues.
They have been four wars of India with Pakistan starting from very 1948 and extending to 65, 71 and 99. 
In 1947 India emerged as a secular nation with Hindu majority and a large population being Muslim while Pakistan became Islamic republic.a year later the first war happened over Kashmir. The issue of Kashmir still an issue even with the  LOC in place. After 4 war and subsequent defeats Pakistan came to know that it cannot win against India traditionally so Pakistan started radicalising the youth of Kashmir and started training them as local flavour stone pelters and insurgents. The war right now is not a traditional one but rather psychological one. In the shadows of shelling Pakistan wishes to breach the borders of Indian territory by aid through various terrorist cells. 
After the removal of article 370 and 35a there has been increase in terrorism in the Kashmir but as we know Indian army has been silencing any who dares threaten peace of country from outside the borders.  Moreover Pakistan accuses India of promoting funding training militants this is a clear cut example of cattle calling the pot black. And just now a news came in which pak pm imran Khan is saying that osama bin laden was a martyr. 

Let us move on to China

The relations with China dates back to ancient times when trade happened through the silk route they came to be known as trading partners early during the very Gupta period.  in modern Times in 2008 India and China both rebuilt their diplomatic ties. Indian china do trade currently in 2020  worth 91 billion US dollars. From economic standpoint these figures are very good but militarily the relations between both countries are strained as of now. India faced a war with china in 1962. In 1965 when India was engaging in a war with Pakistan China West to help Pakistan in sending aid. It was only when India Threatened to blockade strait of malacca that China backedoff. Recently the Galwaan valley in laddakh is on fire with eye Ball confrontations happening on both finger 4 and finger 14 patrolling point. It is due to construction of DSDBO road India's making on this side of the LOC.
The other clause of conflict is the non admittance of LAC on both sides India believes that 1 -8  fingers are in Indian territory whilr China believes that whole galwaan area is theirs and India should recall it's troops from there. 
This resulted in a wave over banning Chinese products in india whose impact has not yet felt but some economists believe it is a right step to take. 

Nepal : the relations India shares with nepal have generally been good be it in reign of Girija Prasad koirala or mr pushp Kamal dahal. India is Nepal's largest trade partner and largest source of foreign exchange. India imports juice, oil, cakes, jute goods, noodles, handicrafts etc. India shares open boundry with nepal through sonouli. 
When CPN nepal came into power, pm kp Sharma oli has been flexing muscles as his tenure as pm is on the verge of ending. The border issues and territorial disputes over kalapani area which falls under indian administration but also been claimed by nepal since 1985 has reemerged. Nepal as a whole is not a threat to Indian territory militarily but aggressing nepal could cause another front to open for India to station BSF. 

BANGLADESH : AFter India went to war in 1971 Pakistan was defeated and east Pakistan was liberated as a sovereign nation bangladesh. The bilateral trade and economic relations remained good throughout the times with bangladesh. India does a trade of 12B USD with bangladesh. Aside from naval border disputes the imminent problem is the rising number of illegal immigrants which come to Indian soil through assam, west bengal. It also declines resources and Per capita income of the region. 

Though India's main strategic partners remain to be Russia Iran and America. Iran has been very good friend of India for a long time now. India imports majority of oil from Iran also India has invested in chabar Port of Iran to develop and check the rising ambition of gwadar Port which is a part of cpec and b r i of dragon. The chahbar port also allows access to Western and Central Russia through land route. also Farkhor airbase in Tajikistan is near to it. 
India has given 1 billion US dollars aid to Russia to develop its port city of vladvostok so as to promote trade but also there are ambitions as well. The land is rich in natural resources and gas which India plans to get a part of to the state. More over the navel route from Chennai to vladvostok cuts through South China sea which is there to check ambition of China in South China sea. It is also excuse to station more Navy in the strait of malacca. India also buys missiles and aircrafts from Russia the Mig series and s-400 triumph are prime examples.

America has always been supportive of Pakistan from 1954 pact of Iran but slowly giving more attention 2 india lately. Of course India provides America with the market and buyer.
India has a trade of 54 billion US dollars with America. India sold 22 billion worth of Steel to US last year India also buys various jets and missiles from US as well . the Lockheed Martin is known to India in form of F-21 which both Lockheed Martin and Tata is producing in India. India has also signed COMCASA with US in 2018 which would enable any two US manufactured weapons to communicate in between.
India has good relations with many other countries like France who is supporting us to get a seat on UNSC.
IN THE END THE CREDIT GOES TO INDIAN DIPLOMATS AND MINISTRY  OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.there have been many cases when India continue trading with two hostile Nations amongst each other that is basically what happened between US and Iran
these points are what I believe. Any critics and suggestions are welcome 🙏

While the generational gap itself is immense, to me, the gap in interests is far, far wider. 

As a result of that, I frequently get into arguments with him, largely because he tends to yell whenever things tend not to go his way. This yelling could be triggered by anything, including but not limited to: trying to use his phone to google about the fresh dates for our exams (pre-college), pointing out his flawed logic when he says eating fruits at night causes diarrhea, or whenever he can't find something he himself misplaced. He can't listen to even constructive criticism, even when he himself asks for it,(he runs an experimental drama troupe where he wants to do this weird cringe-inducing campy show where an alien helps a village kid \[no more details, or I'll be identifiable\], and when he asked me if kids would ""love"" the show, I said they wouldn't attend unless there's something better in his show than watching The Avengers at home, and he said he never asked for my advice, even though he literally asked for it seconds ago. Since then, I've realized he only wants me to praise his work, even if it is a pile of horse-shit), and worst of all, he even piles my mother along in his complaining. 

For context, my mother works at the same place, at the same post as my father, and somehow, my mother has turned into this reserved, non-outgoing person with what I perceive is a severe lack of self-confidence, perhaps stemming from this flawed relationship, even if she denies it. He's even gone as far as to say he married the wrong person, while I can easily attest to the fact that half the reason he can reliably spend his time doing the theatre at all is because my mother and I often do the letter-writing, brochure-making, etc, which he absolutely refuses to be grateful for. 

He'll yell, and because I can't stand being yelled at for no reason, I'll point out that I'm not one of his cronies at the theatre who would praise him for yelling (and I've learnt to say that without yelling) and he'll storm off, call me unworthy of being his son (big deal \\s), and go to his room upstairs. He's threatened to commit suicide (blackmail, and only because I told him not to go for a voice recording session the day after the lockdown was announced, for a project made for making people aware not to go out during the lockdown. He shouted about how I had made an ""artist"" unable to practice his ""art"", and accused my mother of helping me, when she'd been silent, as ""being silent meant she supported me""). 

And while some of the time, he'll come back, realize he needs me to edit his videos or write a letter, and say sorry just to get me do his job, most of the time, he'll make up shit, tell me I'm at fault, say I started the argument, even when he was the one who yelled (according to him, he can yell whenever he wants, as he's the ""father""), there have been times when we haven't talked for two weeks, and then started talking again.  

I mean, I get that he loves me as a son, and I am proud of the fact that he allows me to study whatever the fuck I want at school or college, but I am absolutely pissed at the fact that this yelling severely debilitates my study regimen, at a time when I need to get my shit together for my entrance exams, that seem to be getting indefinitely delayed due to the pandemic.

So, fathers of r/india, what do you have to say about this? How do you bridge that gap between your children? Or, as sons, how do you think it should be bridged? I don't want to grow up and have my family (if I end up with one) being strained due to my needless temper.",False,0.77,Non-Political

hf1ilm,Musk_is_batman,Tale of Examinations in the era of Covid [XL][OC],1593007264.0,,False,True,True,False,t3_hf1ilm,2,False,18,"Hello all dear readers, I would like to share my experience of giving the UGEE exam during this time of high crisis and pandemic. It is truly a unique and unprecedented situation out there. It seems all gloomy and dark for our future. The light at the end of tunnel which had emerged due to the nearing of the end of exams is starting to fade away into oblivion now. 

Anyways let me share my experience with you all. Nearly 2000 students gave the exam at my centre (TCS iON Digital Zone-1 Sarita Vihar). Huge crowd, the first I saw after the end of my boards and that too pales in comparison especially in the lockdown. It almost, almost felt that we had reached the normal and things were looking like the pre Covid era. 

Upon reaching there, huge crowd at the entrance comprising of various parents, their wards. Numerous support staff were also present there. Moreover hawkers selling “Shikanji”, Chips and other too were also present. Though arguably people were less near those (but were there). There was huge disregard to social distancing all around, and it is to be expected as huge number of students are coming and there is only one entry points which serves as a choke point. 

After undergoing one thermal screening and going inside the main gate, there was a huge serpentine line snaking itself towards the building entry gate. Everybody had masks on, and those whose mask was put on improperly were severely reprimanded and were asked to ensure it covers their mouth and nose. There were people checking the “Aarogya Setu” application on the mobile phone, but there was a huge shortcoming there. Those who either didn’t have or had one with the yellow ( at risk) page were sent to one line and the others with the green, you are safe dashboard were sent to the other side. 

I don’t own a smartphone, so was standing in the non “Aarogya Setu” line and lo behold, a person with a yellow dashboard, standing at just a few paces ahead of me. ~~At that moment I truly felt that this pandemic has spread like wildfire across the nation.~~ The phones were kept in a storage locker (much like the ones we use to keep our footwear outside of temples), and tokens were provided to their owners. Everyone was sanitising their hands at regular intervals with their own sanitisers. 

After the long queue finally ended, came the seat matrix bill board. There was only one billboard and thousands of students had to see them, leading to chaos and again lack of social distancing. I quickly found my seat, sanitised my hands. Those who did not have gloves were provided rubber latex gloves. I already had them on. By the time I reached my seat I was perspiring heavily. The masks started to irritate me. The gloves got so sticky and there was a partial vacuum inside them. It truly was a really uncomfortable experience. As the exam dragged on, so did my frustration with the gloves and mask as nearly all of us preparing for the entrance exams for the past 2 years have not practised writing exams while wearing gloves and mask. 

During the biometrics everyone needs to remove mask and gloves (which are already sticky). Photo is being taken. Then we have to give thumb impression using the same stamp pad used by hundreds other before me and quite possibly hundreds after me. 

Moreover inside the examination hall as well there was no social distancing observed. People were crammed in like sardines in a tin. There were 5 people within arms distance of me. Well what can be done the seats are assigned randomly by the computer. 

Soon the exam was over and we were free. We were asked to exit in a row wise manner. Soon after going outside it was the same shenanigans again. A complete disregard for private space let alone social distancing. People were rushing like idiots to reach the exit first and grab their bags and phones and other belongings. Initially at the time of entry there were much lesser people compared to what had become now. Every parent standing there waiting for their ward to arrive. 

In all I believe it is very risky to conduct an exam in such a manner and poses great risk not only to us, but also our parents and all those who live with us. It is practically impossible to develop the habit of keeping the mask and gloves and still solving a strenuous paper at the same time. 

I appeal to all the relevant authorities to kindly keep in mind everyones health and welfare and in my honest opinion it is unsafe to conduct exams in such a manner.

He then assaults a lady officer which is caught in CCTV. The violent way in which  he throws her results in her having fractured bones. Just imagine if a police man in plain clothes can do that in bank premises to a woman public servant, what else may go on inside a police station.
And on top of that there is no FIR filed yet since he is a policeman.

### Tl;dr

Recent reports by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab have evidenced the presence of large-scale phishing, and spyware hacking scams in the country. A joint report by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab has reported on how a Spyware software was used to spy on various Indian civil rights activists, journalists and lawyers. Another study by Citizen Lab brings to light the presence of a New Delhi-based hacking firm that has targeted advocacy groups, journalists, elected government officials, and multiple industries on six continents. More credence is lent to such claims, now that the MeitY’s own nodal agency, CERT-in has come out with an advisory warning people about an impending large-scale email phishing attack in major Indian cities. Amidst such blatant attacks against privacy, autonomy, and liberty, we wrote to the Committee on IT to take note of these important developments. We also wrote to the Hon’ble Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Hon’ble Chairman of the Rajya Sabha making a case that moving legislative business to virtual platforms is not only urgent, but that the existing rules can be used to easily make this change.  


### Well, what is “Phishing” and “Spyware”?

We know you probably know that, “phishing”, and, “spyware” attacks are something to guard against but what are they exactly? Also, why are they such a grave threat to your cyber security and privacy?   


* [**Phishing or Spearphishing is defined by Kaspersky**](https://www.kaspersky.co.in/resource-center/definitions/spear-phishing) as, ‘an email or electronic communications scam targeted towards a specific individual, organization or business. Although often intended to steal data for malicious purposes, cybercriminals may also intend to install malware on a targeted user’s computer’. In other words, it is a fraudulent technique through which the receiver of an electronic message like an email or a message is made to visit a fraudulent website by clicking a link. Through this they may be tricked into divulging sensitive information like passwords, financial information and other personal information. This can take place either directly, through fake versions of popular websites like Twitter, Facebook or Google or indirectly, through deployment of a Spyware software that secretly gets installed on the victim’s system via this link.  
[**Spyware is defined**](https://www.kaspersky.co.in/resource-center/threats/spyware) as, ‘software that’s designed to gather data from a computer or other device and forward it to a third party without the consent or knowledge of the user. This often includes collecting confidential data such as passwords, PINs and credit card numbers, monitoring keyword strokes, tracking browsing habits and harvesting email addresses.’ Simply put, it is a family of softwares aimed at stealing information about a person or a group of persons without their knowledge and sending it to another entity. Spyware often operates by gaining control of the victim’s computer without consent and then relaying gathered information like internet activity data and passwords via cookies, which are usually consented for. Phishing and Spyware can work in tandem– a phishing email can lead to the installation of a spyware software on the victims’ computers.  


### Massive Cybersecurity Threats in India

Over the past few weeks two international organisations – Amnesty International, and Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary research group at the University of Toronto, Canada have published detailed reports establishing a concrete idea about the serious nature of cybersecurity threats, and data privacy breaches that the country is facing.  


* **Cyber Attack on the Bhima Koregaon 11 :** First one of these is [**a joint report by Amnesty International and Citizen Lab**](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/research/2020/06/india-human-rights-defenders-targeted-by-a-coordinated-spyware-operation/) detailing how a commercially available Spyware called NetWire was deployed via phishing emails to spy on 9 civil rights activists, journalists and lawyers. [**Their computer systems were hacked into to monitor their actions and communications**](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/activists-fighting-for-release-of-bhima-koregaon-11-targeted-by-spyware-in-2019-amnesty-11592404556139.html), which is a direct violation of their right to freedom of expression, and the right to privacy guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. Incidentally, 8 of the  9 victims of this spyware attack have been demanding the release of the Bhima Koregaon 11, a group of human and social rights activists currently under arrest amidst a pending trial. Furthermore, at least 3 of these 9 victims were also [**targeted by the widely discussed  NSO’s Pegasus spyware in 2019**](https://thewire.in/tech/pegasus-spyware-bhima-koregaon-activists-warning-whatsapp).
* **A homegrown blackhat phishing firm:** Second is [**an investigative report by Citizen Lab**](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/06/dark-basin-uncovering-a-massive-hack-for-hire-operation/) revealing the presence of an internationally active hacking firm in New Delhi. This firm, named BellTroX InfoTech Services has been mentioned in the report in relation to providing services to clients that aimed at hacking individuals, organisations and industrial entities on six continents. It has been [**reported**](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cyber-mercenaries-exclusive/exclusive-obscure-indian-cyber-firm-spied-on-politicians-investors-worldwide-idUSKBN23G1GQ) that these victims include advocacy groups and journalists, elected and senior government officials, hedge funds, and multiple industries. More specifically, the group was behind the phishing of organizations working on net neutrality advocacy. Also, American organisations working on the #ExxonKnew campaign, which claimed that Exxon Mobil held back evidence on climate change and global warming for decades were targeted by BellTroX.
* **You could be next:** The serious implications of these findings gain more credence in light of an advisory (CIAD-2020-0040, dated 19 June 2020) by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), an official government agency, which asserts that nearly 2 million Indian email addresses are vulnerable to an impending phishing attack. It is suggested that such an attack can be carried out under the pretext of providing  receivers help by posing as ‘...government agencies, departments, and trade associations who have been tasked to oversee the disbursement of government fiscal aid’. Added to this is the fact that the email might be from an ‘official sounding’ email address like ‘[**ncov2019@gov.in**](mailto:ncov2019@gov.in)’, which makes it even more dangerous and harmful for the citizens. 

&#x200B;

Here is what the malicious email can look like:  


https://preview.redd.it/yyfviz4fpt651.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb9ba41d71a514f9a198ddfc070b7f3aab3751d3

It is clear that such cybersecurity threats, which clearly put the privacy, security, and freedom of expression of the citizens at risk, cannot be treated as rare incidents anymore and need to be dealt with with a robust framework in place.   


Therefore, IFF sent a letter to the members of the Parliamentary Committee on IT requesting them to take note of these recent findings and urging them to further the cause of restoring legislative business through virtual committee meetings. However, it does not help that there is a severe lack of legislative discussion around these issues. Furthermore, the  possibility of such a discussion has been stymied by the fact that the Parliament has been reluctant in adopting remote conferencing platforms for carrying out legislative business, especially the standing committee meetings.  


### Absence of Legislative Action

The urgent need for Parliamentary debate on such issues that directly endanger autonomy, privacy and liberty of all Indian citizens is an undeniable fact.   


We were disappointed to know that the meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on Information Technology, which was scheduled to be held on 10 June, 2020 was called off by the Hon’ble Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Even though in-person attendance could not have been ensured amidst the rising cases of COVID-19, the reluctance in adapting to remote conference technologies is disappointing.   


Regarding this, the Hon’ble Chairperson of the Committee on IT, Dr. Shashi Tharoor tweeted (quoting the Hon’ble Speaker) that the meeting cannot be held virtually without the rules being amended, in a process that involves agreement of the Rules Committee and a vote in the House.

https://preview.redd.it/ntkhtgoipt651.png?width=477&format=png&auto=webp&s=e58b3ebc7ae3e05cdfa31de48a0c313149dd2a37

So, pressing for action, we wrote to the [**Hon’ble Speaker**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAB1pJWLEdZvDJA0yJXvPsFkwfYksXtxT4esqQEEuAY/edit) and the [**Hon’ble Chairman of the Rajya Sabha**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ivkaLL5GW23eulZpOqQy73UQjwcvcIHt122dO1pDTmk/edit) making a case that the corresponding Rules of Procedure and Business do provide enough power to the Hon’ble Speaker and the Hon’ble Chairman to constitute these changes, if they will.

We pointed out that specifically, Rule 331K of the *Rules and Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha* and Rules 275 and 81 of the *Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Council of States* do pave way for adoption of remote conferencing tools with their consent.   


We, at IFF,  believe that as the world’s largest democracy and one of the biggest powerhouses in Information Technology, India has both the reason and the technical know-how to effortlessly bring this change to fruition. The reason for pushing for this transition becomes even stronger when such pressing issues like autonomy, dignity, privacy and freedom of expression are at stake. It is also interesting to consider that countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil and New Zealand among others have duly incorporated online conferencing tools to conduct their legislative business. This fact has been highlighted well in these Op-eds by [**M.R. Madhavan**](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/indias-parliament-is-missing-in-action/article31742536.ece) and [**Chakshu Roy**](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/coronavirus-covid-19-meeting-moving-house-online-6371526/), the President, and the Head of Civic and Legislative Engagement at PRS, respectively.  


We intend to follow up and will keep urging all our parliamentary institutions to take clear steps to protect your digital rights.

* BJP succeeded because it was able to consolidate those on the ‘right’, that is, citizens who do not want the state intervening in social norms, redistributing property, recognizing minorities, and who equate democracy with majoritarian values.
* The share of the upper-caste vote within BJP’s Hindu social coalition has continuously declined while the proportion of the other backward castes (OBCs), scheduled castes (SCs), and scheduled tribes (STs) voting for it have increased.
* BJP voters are more majoritarian but not as religious or in favour of Hindu nationalism as those who did not vote for the BJP.
* The analysis presented in this paper suggests that the BJP’s new social coalition is driven less by malleable factors such as leadership and reconvening welfare benefits, and more due to structural shifts. Thus, it appears that this coalition is stable for the foreseeable future as far as national elections are concerned.

Going to war with China is absolutely not an option. Period.

##**Differences :**

Some useless stats which y'all will dismiss 
[Indian military budget : ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_India) (which btw a good chunk goes to maintaince and pensions rather than arms) : $$


[Chinese Military budget ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_China) : $$$$$$
 

This isn't WW2 where the larger the army the more chances they have of winning. It's more about the technological gap too. Now India also [imports ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_industry_of_India) around 50% of the defense equipment it uses meanwhile China has a comparably wayy [larger](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-global-arms-trade/) in house manufacturing going on. Also [modernization ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernization_of_the_People%27s_Liberation_Army) 
Of the Chinese army has been going on for years now meanwhile in India it has barely began. Also China in case of a conflict can significantly ramp up it production of arms but India might have to struggle here.


##**Allies**

Now seeing as how India is one of the largest importer of arms we need allies more than China does clearly. 
And our allies are unreliable at best. The biggest arms exporters to India are mainly Russia, Israel, and NATO.

[Chinese ](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/new-sipri-data-reveals-scale-chinese-arms-industry) arms manufacturing is all set to overtake Russia by a big fat margin.
Now god forbid war breaks out, Russian intervention would come for sure but its unreliable at best. Russia is a close a [friend ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Russian_relations_since_1991) of China as well. I frankly speaking don't see them choosing a side unless they are sure that side is gonna win (kinda like Tywin Lannister). Plus Russia has already ruled out [mediation ](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/russia-india-china-meeting-india-china-dont-need-outside-help-says-russian-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov-2250912?amp=1&akamai-rum=off).

Israel can't be expected to provide anything more than arms support. Their security forces have enough headaches as it is.

Now the big daddy Murica, Trump is pretty anti-Chinese and for good reason. China in some years may even start threatening US as a superpower. Let's be honest India isn't on that level yet. Plus China is America's [biggest export patner](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China). Also public opinion on foreign wars is pretty anti war in the US. USA going to war against China is a very remote possibility. 

Not to mention Pakistan which is frankly China's boy toy.

See how India is virtually friendless and could be fighting a war on *two* fronts. 

Ffs a war on one front is horrendous, being pushed on both frontiers would be disastrous.

##**Nuclear capabilities and missile capabilities**

China has an unknown amt of strategic warheads but [estimates ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction) say it's around 290. With a missile range of 14000km. Largest yield was **4 MT** ( atmospheric), **600 to 1000 kt** (underground)

India has around 130 to 140 through [estimates ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction). 
With a peak yield of **45 KT** and a range of 5000 km to 8000 km. 

You can clearly see India is an underdog here.

Heck you don't need hundreds of nuclear weapons. India and China are home to many of the most densely packed and populated areas. A nuclear war between the two countries is highly unlikely but if it happens (god forbid) the death toll would be in millions, it would likely impact the entire continent. Truly a horrific and nightmarish scenario.

##Historic 

China doesn't back down *willingly*, it's not a democratic country ffs. China is extremely aggressive and pushes hard on territorial disputes. Plus remember Doklam ? China [ never backed down ](https://theprint.in/defence/near-doklam-china-is-again-increasing-forces-building-roads-even-a-possible-heliport/215512/?amp)

Now while China has pushed into Indian territory (sorta). India is on defence and while even if it wanted to go and play offence against China. We would be sacrificing lives of our amrymen and for what ? A barren land ?!? 

Its has pure strategic value and that's why China is pushing down and now they have the land and can negotiate from a place of strength and [they are doing it. ](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chinas-galwan-valley-claims-mark-shift-from-past/article31867941.ece/amp/)

We actually dead in water and the only solution would be to demarcate the entire border to avoid more human casualties. Our army is brave enough sure. But hence war isn't even remotely realistic. We would just be using the army as cannon fodder (war in a nutshell).

On top that India is facing a shrinking economy and high number of coronavirus cases. This is perhaps why China even decided to push. Yes even China can't afford a war but we *really* can't. 

Hence ffs stop thinking from your ego and dicks and apply a lil logic and perspective. 
Demarcation is only the viable long term solution. And both Modi and Winnie the Pooh need to back down. Which frankly speaking would hurt their political images too, hence [why war is a man's game ](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.0975)

Plus we aren't on that lvl, but see what the post 9/11 military campaigns are [costing](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/) the US taxpayers. Heck tho USA has a lotta foreign support, they get Japan, Saudi to write big cheques. Whose gonna write one for India ??",False,0.74,Politics

And surprisingly I found the answer in my own experiences.

&#x200B;

**My fight with jaundice** :  A few years ago, I suffered with jaundice. Most people who have been through it knows that there is no obvious medicine for jaundice but a slow remedial process with some medication to repair the liver and extreme restricted dietary discipline. I had no success in bringing down my bilirubin levels to normal for more than a month. As a desperate resort upon suggestion of a family friend we visited a village which provides some natural medication for jaundice. It is called 'Pasara Vaidyam'. When I went there, there were hundreds of people around there waiting for them to come check and provide the medication. The medication is packets of pasted leaves(don't know which leaf) which they give once a week or month. I noticed it is same medication for everyone. All they asked is eat only milk rice and have it once a day for three days. Followed by drinking castor oil on fourth day. To my disbelief my bilirubin levels were back to normal within a week. I was even allowed to eat non veg after two weeks.

I totally forgot about this experience till yesterday. And yesterday I started asking myself, was that a placebo? how does that work on everyone? What am I missing? How do you classify natural medications that work and that don't?

&#x200B;

**Another experience :** I use a soap that my grand father used to use to wash my hair. This one is never advertised. When I moved to US, I thought there is no way I will find it. To my surprise it is available in most Indian stores in the US. I don't know anyone in real life who uses it other than me and my dad but here it is easily available in the US.

How does this unadvertised products have users in the US?

&#x200B;

Upon pondering over these questions and experiences, here is what I think: 

If it works you need not actually advertise. This applies for any product. The jaundice medicine I took and the hair soap were not advertised but were effective and widely used with lot of silent users. **Empty vessels are noisy.**

*Not all natural sciences are pseudo sciences but there are many pseudo sciences that pretend to be natural sciences.* 

Discarding natural sciences as pseudo science is also a disservice to knowledge available. 

Being rational beings, it is necessary for us to have scientifically proven medicines. So it is true that natural medicines need to be researched upon and scientifically prove their effectiveness but at the same time it is not fair to categorize all natural medicines as pseudo sciences.

&#x200B;

We broke up with mutual understanding. After the break-up, I discovered she had found her next guy while we were in the relationship. We were intimately involved; and that includes sexting too. I never shared any of her private pictures with others. I have deleted all the pictures/videos shortly after the break up. My old phone that I used back then is still with me, so no chance of it going in hands of a wrong person.

Last week, she messaged me out of blue accusing me of having leaked her video on a porn site. She's threatening me to file a police complaint against me. I'm sure I never did what she's implying, so police cannot ideally find any evidence against me. In best case, I will be interrogated. In worst case, I will be their scapegoat. 

I haven't replied to her at all. Because anything I might say would be construed wrongly given the distress she's in. I don't think my silence is helping either but it won't be held against me. I obviously cannot ask her to link me to the video to verify if it's the one I have seen. There's a good chance it can be some other boyfriend of hers. 

My main concern if this goes to the cops, will my involvement as an accused dog me throughout the rest of my life? Will it affect my chances of getting a professional visa or even residency? I cannot get myself to risk my career at this point.

An educated aunt said that a rich and successful person can never be depressed and so Sushant could not have been depressed. Her young son added that as per social media Sushant was partying a few nights before his demise so he couldn't have been depressed for sure. They further added that nothing can justify suicide.

I revealed that I had dealt with depression for a long time and had to take therapy to overcome it. I had been suicidal multiple times in my life and it still takes me a lot of effort to deal with my mental health. They had no sympathy for me and didn't believe me at all when I said that a person who seems happy from the outside could actually be dealing with depression.

hax1wf,spawnofdexter,*Trigger Warning: mentions of suicide* How can one help someone with mental health problems? (from the Hindu and Dr.Soumitra Pathare call),1592418440.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hax1wf,2,False,19,"I just watched some part of the talk between The Hindu and Dr.Soumitra Pathare,  Director Centre for Mental Health Law & Policy ILS. There were a few things that he said about how one can help people going through mental health.  The actual call is about an hour long and I suggest you listen to it as there are more topics regarding mental health discussed.

If you cannot, I wrote a few things down (I will be paraphrasing here as I wrote them down as the call was going on)-

1. Just be there for them. Just being there might help a person a lot.
2. Try and talk to them. Do not have to be a trained psychiatrist to try and talk to them. Do not have to psycho-analyze them. Talk about normal stuff, like asking if they have eaten or offering to eat together. Just being a fellow human and a friend with them might help them a lot.
3. Someone going through a rough time might indicate that they are going through it by saying things like ""I just hope I don't wake up tomorrow."" or ""I wish I would just disappear off this world."" When someone says something like that, it's an indication and they are looking to talk to you about this. In that case, do not laugh it off or make jokes about it. It belittles their struggle and they will shut themselves off.
4. Do not say ""You mustn't think like that."" They are not thinking about it voluntarily. It is happening to them. And if you say a statement like that, they will feel that you are not understanding them and might shut themselves off.
5. Asking if someone is feeling suicidal is not wrong and you won't trigger them into suicide. Try and listen to them and offer help.
6. Sometimes just venting helps. So, even if you cannot offer any advice or not say anything, just by sitting there and listening to them might help them a lot.
7. If you know someone who has attempted suicide, do no ignore them. It is the worst thing you could do. Approach them and let them know that you are available if they want to talk. Do not go overboard and make a public display. Just letting them know is enough.
8. Do not ostracize someone who has a mental illness or has attempted suicide. Do not consider suicide a crime and ostracize them. Suicide unless proven otherwise a person is considered to be under stress. (More on that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_309_of_the_Indian_Penal_Code#:~:text=Section%20309%20states%3A,with%20fine%2C%20or%20with%20both)). So, you can talk to them, if the worry of illegal activity was stopping you.
9. If anyone you know is going through a rough time, let them know that you are available to meet them and/or talk to them. Do not push them to share with you. They should feel comfortable doing that and if and when they do, please listen.
10. Do not reveal the identity of a person with mental illness without their consent. It is a huge breach of trust.
11. Do not share pictures of people's suicidal acts or suicide notes. You might share with people who might be vulnerable and might trigger them.
12. If someone calls you, saying that they are about to commit suicide, then your aim should be to keep them on call as long as possible. Do not panic. They called you because they trust you enough to share this information at such a vulnerable time. Offer to meet them and talk to them. Offer to bring someone along, a loving friend, or a relative with you to meet them. Do not suggest they talk to a doctor. They called you to talk to you, not a doctor. A suggestion to talk to a doctor might make them feel rejected. There is no specific narrative script as it depends on the situation but this is the basic thing that can be done.

For someone who needs help, please talk to a friend or a relative who you think might listen and understand you.

The strongest person, with a strong independent voice will fade into the darkness only to avoid the burden placed upon their own shoulders.......

I've seen the same thing slowly starting to happen to /r/cozyplaces as well, and it feels like it's getting worse lately. The titles often refer to having experienced hardship like abusive spouses, abusive parents, or drug abuse. Not trying to shame people who've had bad experiences, it just isn't relevant for an aesthetic/interior/architecture-type sub. 

I truly believe that if we (the sub) and the mods don't agree on some rules to moderate titles, this will only get worse. The sub is large, has attracted a lot of ""mainstream"" redditors that focus more on a good story than a good room/cozy place, and as it continues to grow I suspect it'll only get worse. People were complaining about mediocre pictures with long, emotional titles on /r/pics for years, and now it's just gone full Facebook-mode. Further driving away content creators to more niche picture subs, making the content on /r/pics even more generic and story/title-focused. I believe this is the direction this sub is headed if we don't do something, when stories get upvotes, it just makes more people post stories to increase their chances of getting upvoted. 

I'm not suggesting we directly ban these type of posts, but I think it's time for a discussion on what to do with it. I've seen others complain about sob stories in comments, but maybe we're a overly critical minority. I'd love to hear what everyone thinks about it, and what the mods think about it. 

My suggestion would be to decide on having short, descriptive titles, like on several art subs. It's never a full description of what's in the picture, or a story about how the picture was taken (like the /r/earthporn cliché of waking up early and hiking for x amount of hours). Just a short and often a little artsy title, like ""after the storm"" on a picture of a rainy day, or ""imitating nature"" on a picture of a hand looking like a plant. But then again, we can't force people to come up with artsy titles, hmmm. 

Most importantly, moving the story behind the cozy place to the comments would reduce the impact on upvotes while still letting people share their story. Just my 5 cents, what do you all think?",False,0.93,

 Android AI Chat Apps! 
(Android apps are LIVE, much less intrusive and resource intensive... DOWNLOAD NOW! 
A streamlined, less heavy version of the banned books bot lives here:
 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dcss.bannedbooks 
and another way to see how kinky the computer can be lives here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dcss.flirtbot 

I made a bunch of different AIs, but today I improved my strategy and built AIs that have context from your existing conversation and tries to communicate conversationally rather than as a question-asnwering type chat.


The best news?


I built this particular one on The Ricky Gervais Show featuring Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington - all the transcripts I could find ;)


http://jare.cloud/the-ricky-gervais-show-featuring-steve-merchant-and-karl-pilkington-chat-bot/


I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...


http://jare.cloud/sexy-flirt-bot/


I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....


http://jare.cloud/banned-books-bot/


(note that the last 2 are being re-trained from acting as question-answering bots to being more conversational bots that have context from the last messages as we speak :) be about 5 more hours before they're live-worthy....)


This one simply draws it's wealth of knowledge from a subsection of reddit posts, and is probably the most likely to beat the Turing test of all of them:

 It's a frighteningly dark infinite text adventure game. It learns how to get under your skin and test your paradigms. 
 Seriously, there are YouTubes upon youtubes on this. OG dev llives at github, in a user called aidungeon and repo of the same.

 Android AI Chat Apps! 
(Android apps are LIVE, much less intrusive and resource intensive... DOWNLOAD NOW! 
A streamlined, less heavy version of the banned books bot lives here:
 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dcss.bannedbooks 
and another way to see how kinky the computer can be lives here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dcss.flirtbot 

I made a bunch of different AIs, but today I improved my strategy and built AIs that have context from your existing conversation and tries to communicate conversationally rather than as a question-asnwering type chat.


The best news?


I built this particular one on The Ricky Gervais Show featuring Steve Merchant and Karl Pilkington - all the transcripts I could find ;)


http://jare.cloud/the-ricky-gervais-show-featuring-steve-merchant-and-karl-pilkington-chat-bot/


I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...


http://jare.cloud/sexy-flirt-bot/


I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....


http://jare.cloud/banned-books-bot/


(note that the last 2 are being re-trained from acting as question-answering bots to being more conversational bots that have context from the last messages as we speak :) be about 5 more hours before they're live-worthy....)


This one simply draws it's wealth of knowledge from a subsection of reddit posts, and is probably the most likely to beat the Turing test of all of them:

I built this one to flirt with you regardless of the time of day, or such stresses common folk have like headaches or being toooo tired...


http://jare.cloud/sexy-flirt-bot/


I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....

(note that the last 2 are being re-trained from acting as question-answering bots to being more conversational bots that have context from the last messages as we speak :) be about 5 more hours before they're live-worthy....)


This one simply draws it's wealth of knowledge from a subsection of reddit posts, and is probably the most likely to beat the Turing test of all of them:

 Android AI Chat Apps! 
(Android apps are LIVE, much less intrusive and resource intensive... DOWNLOAD NOW! 
A streamlined, less heavy version of the banned books bot lives here:
 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dcss.bannedbooks 
and another way to see how kinky the computer can be lives here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dcss.flirtbot 

I made a bunch of different AIs, but today I improved my strategy and built AIs that have context from your existing conversation and tries to communicate conversationally rather than as a question-asnwering type chat.

You don’t know what you’re meant to be doing or how you can utilize your skills to bring value to other. So often we’re told that we should seek to find our passion. While this is true, there’s a little bit more to consider.

An age-old Japanese philosophy called **Ikiga**i has been known to allow people to live a long and happy life. This is especially true in Okinawa, which is home to the largest number of centenarians in the world.

The way that I was able to move closer to my purpose was to consider 4 components of one’s life that allows one to find their Ikigai

\-What I love

\-What I am good at

\-What the world needs

\-What I can get paid for

So often we tend to assume these components as completely separate from each other but they’re much more intertwined than we know. This is such an awesome concept and I explain this in depth here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOZtBlrMvek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOZtBlrMvek)

A week ago I successfully finished my PhD. In the field in which I did my PhD study and for the professor I worked for, you have to publish your work and must have a certain amount of successful publications at renowned journals before you can even start dreaming about writing your thesis. During this time, I got more rejections from these journals than I got accept notifications. However, I improved the work and got every single paper I wrote accepted eventually. Some even at the most renowned journals of my field. The thing I had to learn is that rejection is part of improvement and success.

Not every idea I had bore fruits. I worked on projects which I had to cancel because they did simply not work out. And in the country I did my PhD you only have a limited amount of time in which you can finish your thesis. So these ones were especially painful, but never a waste of time because I learned so much from these ""failures"".

The constant pressure, the rejections, doubts I had about myself, and little confirmation from the outside got the better of me somewhere in between. I broke down and could not do anything anymore. I was not able to leave the house. I was not able to make food. My life felt in pieces and I was thinking I am broken beyond repair. And still, I kept on going and managed to get through it. Do not get me wrong. This did not magically disappear and everything was fine. I have to work on it daily. Some days more, some days less, some days I am not thinking about it. Ones in a while I am still near panic attacks, however, I learned how to handle them and the fear of them disappeared. Today, anxiety is more annoying than actually fearful.

And then, after placing one foot after the other I finally got my PhD. So to everyone out there doubting themselves, perhaps even having depressions or panic attacks. It will work out eventually. Just taking one day at a time and keep on going really works. I know, because today I realized that I did it :)

As the title says, your future is a clean slate. Even if you think you've lived a 1/10 life so far, you can put 10/10 effort going forward and see a huge difference from where you are right now.  It'll take time, as all things do, but you may as well start.  A week from now you could be a week into a whole list of new daily habits - eating better, working out, learning a new skill; whatever you want to improve on, you can get there.  It'll take time.  It could take a lot of time depending on what it is, but it's worth it.  You know it's worth it.  

A month from now you could have a completely different mindset.  That's what changing your habits does.

I feel like these days I see so many people who have given up and resigned themselves to mediocrity.  They've essentially come to terms with the 'fact' that things will always be the way they are, and coast through just waiting to die.   That's not a fact.  That's a decision.  

As a great black Irish inmate once said, ""That's all it takes really.  Pressure, and time"".  Changing your small habits and being consistent with the changes is ultimately the key to growing as a person and getting to where you want to get. 

I don't know you.  I don't know your goals or your aspirations, but I guarantee that whatever they are, you can take the first step towards them today if you want to.  And I suspect most of you know what that first step is.

I've always believed there are 2 versions of a person - the person they are now, and the person they could become if they worked with what they have.  Visualize the very best possible version of yourself; the best you can achieve with what you have.  How do they look? How do they think or behave or dress and how do they spend your time?  You could be that person.  You have far more potential than you think.  

**TL;DR**

* Small changes in your habits lead to huge results over time

* You have far more potential than you think

* You have far more control of who you are and where you end up than you think

* Start by starting

* It's never too late to start fresh and fix everything (for the most part)",False,0.96,

If you walked into a room that only had a TV and Sofa and you decide to watch TV you think that's your decision.

B. If you walked into a room with just a chair and book and you decided to sit down and read a book you think that's your decision.

Your decisions have been heavily influenced by the design of the room. If you think about the design of your room beforehand you can encourage certain behaviours. There is a lot of research to show that humans tend to do whatever is the easiest thing... that's why supermarkets tap into this - The most profitable items are in the middle of the shelf where you can easily reach, the less profitable items are right at the bottom. Its only a small amount of extra effort but enough to influence you.

[This video here](https://youtu.be/9jsdS2K0W6k) will give you more details about changing your environment but below is a good summary if you prefer to read :)

&#x200B;

**The principle for good environmental design is:**

1. If you want to encourage a good behaviour make it as simple as possible

e.g. Place a toothpick in front of your toothbrush, your downstairs bathroom and in your car (maybe not the last one :D )

2. If you want to discourage a bad behaviour make it as difficult as possible

e.g. The sofa is facing the bookshelf rather than the TV, the TV is unplugged when not in use

&#x200B;

I have applied some design decisions to my environment below to encourage or discourage certain behaviours... please feel free to add more in the comments and ill chuck them in!

1. Only have healthy food on display (fruits, nuts, Carrots...! )
2. Remove all unhealthy food from your house - I need to walk a mile to get a coke!
3. Place your unhealthy cooking equipment in a bag upstairs (frying pan, Pizza Cutter)
4. my face creams are set up in an orderly fashion, so I know exactly when do apply each cream
5. I have my gym clothes laid out ready to go on a chair before i go to bed
6. I have my coffee machine turn on at 7AM every day
7. I prepare healthy full meals and healthy snacks in advance for impulse eating

It took me a long time to figure out what success really meant. I initially failed out of college, became addicted to drugs, and gained a lot of weight. My whole life I was taught to compare myself to others, and obviously with my accolades, it appeared I was failing. Finally, I learned to stop comparing myself, and figure out what success and happiness would mean in my life. 

Life appears easy when you are given a roadmap. We create milestones and goals that we strive to hit each and every year, almost like a video game. Always striving for the next level. Elementary school, middle school, high school, college. Every year, we progress in a procedural way like we’re on repeat. We become conditioned to the uniformity, then finally it just stops.  

You hit your 20s and there’s no clear-cut benchmarking system anymore. You begin to search for your own milestones, but you don’t have a solidified timeline. What comes next? Marriage, kids, a job promotion? There’s no grading scale for success past your 20s. Do you enjoy your job, does your relationship suck, that’s up to you to decide now. Your whole life has been dictated by the imaginary score we keep, but now that’s gone. There is no predetermined next big accomplishment, it is up to you to discover what success and happiness mean in your life. For the first time in your life, you are free to follow your own path, and sometimes that freedom can be overwhelming.   

You need to understand that success looks different to everyone because everyone is different. It is easy to become anxious about your accomplishments when you compare them to those of others, but there is no hard deadline for your personal growth. The sooner you realize, nobody is keeping score, the sooner you can appreciate your life for what it is. Start doing the things you want to do rather than what people are telling you to do. You are more than just a list of accomplishments. Continue to focus on your happiness, try new things, because your personal growth is what lies at the center of your success. The hardest challenge in life is learning to be yourself.",False,0.93,

So we don't do it.

I can tell you from experience that very few things are as unpleasant as you think they will be. Your mind comes up with scenarios that are typically much worse than reality. 

The only thing that's ever been worse than I expected it to be is regret, and I've regretted inaction much more often than I've regretted action. 

If you're putting something off because you're afraid of what might happen, know that, in the end, the regret of inaction will be much more painful. 

You aren't making life easier for yourself by avoiding discomfort. You're just pushing that discomfort onto your future self, and one day you have to be that future self. Don't live a life you'll regret.

Fear of repeating mistakes
Questions the journey you are about to embark
When you know not, if you have it within you
Of conquering territories, that lie un-mapped
When you can't picture the destination, in the eye of your mind
And catch yourself wondering if it will ever be fine

Sit yourself upright
Go splash some water on your face
Perhaps drink some while you're at it
Imagine yourself, back in a safe comfy space

As many splendors as you can think
Double them, triple them and throw in a few extra
Lustrous bodies wrapper around your torso
Exotic fruits and luscious gossip across the spectra

Feel the dulling of your senses 
As your indulgences overcome you 
Throw yourself into the ennui
Of a well-fed tiger breeding in the zoo

As your base desires tighten their grip
Like a boa constrictor squeezing it's prey
Remember the discontent of hedonism
Mindless cravings that lead discipline astray

Yes it's all too difficult
And the statistics certainly don't help
You want to lose all hope
But these are the only cards you've been dealt

Whether your look back and weep
Or look ahead and wail
Stay rooted and muted
Helpless and frail

This is the way of the world
And it will go on
Friends and lovers shall depart
Perhaps the parents stay, of whom you were born

hd672m,MattTheMentor,[Text] Today’s pain is one page in your story - not the only page,1592742735.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hd672m,3,False,10,"I know sometimes you feel like you’re falling apart. I know life can feel pointless. When you’re this far underwater you can’t really feel the light from the surface - you just feel cold and alone.

There’s times you don’t want to be here. Times when all you can see is the pain. What’s the point if everything just hurts? How can I fix anything if I can’t even handle the thought of getting out of bed? How can I reach out to someone and ask for help when I can’t stand feeling broken, and the last thing I want to do is ruin someone else’s day with my problems?

The hardest part for me is that when I’m that far underwater I forget that there’s more in life than the moment I’m feeling right now. I forget life is mostly balanced. There are times I curl up in a ball crying in the shower, but also days I had wonderful hike in beautiful nature. There are times I hated myself for eating a whole pizza,  but also days I was really productive and healthy and proud of myself. Days where I felt completely alone and isolated and also days I made amazing memories with friends or family.

I’m not saying they are perfectly balanced *right now.* People have bad weeks or months or years and you’re not broken or damaged just because it’s been a while since you enjoyed life.

I need you to understand that **feeling pain right now doesn’t mean you’ll never feel something else**. I need you to understand that pain and feeling alone and disappointments and heartbreak are a part of being human. You’re not broken. You’re not alone. There’s nothing wrong with you.

**No human life in all of history was a straight line of increasing happiness.** Every single one was jagged and jerky. They were all unpredictable oscillations between terrible anxiety, exciting whirlwind romance, existential dread, relaxing contentment, neutral boring mundane day, grieving loss, pride of accomplishment, confusion or aimless drifting, and so many more. Life does not follow the 3 act play structure. 

When you’re hurting it’s so hard to remember the high points or imagine you’ll have more. It feels like this pain is all we’ll ever have, it feels hopeless and awful. I know exactly what that feels like and you’re not alone. You’re human and all humans like us have these down moments, but I’m begging you to see that we have up moments too.

Can you see how your life is a roller coaster, and it’s not a bad thing? Can you point to some high points that you’ve had, and see the low points between? I can’t give you a recipe to avoid low points, such a recipe doesn’t exist. But I can be crystal clear that life is not just low points. Life isn’t just tragedies and I am terrified that you’re at the lowest point of your roller coaster right now. You’re looking behind you at how far down you fell and you’re in pain and all you can see is what you’ve lost. All you can feel is how different this is than the life you wanted or expected. All you know is that everything hurts and you don’t know what to do.

I’m terrified that you’re looking back so much that you can’t look forward. You can’t see that the highest point of your roller coaster is right in front of you and things are going to get so much better. I’m sick to my stomach that you’re going to give up on this ride and miss the high points ahead of you just because you thought today’s pain would last forever.

We can’t guess how many low points your life will have. We can’t predict when the high points will happen. But we know for damn sure that life has both highs and lows. We know for damn sure that the pain you feel today won’t last forever. There is more to your story than the heartache you feel right now. Your tears will dry with time and you will smile again. There might be pieces missing from your life right now, but there’s also time to find them. You’ve had days so happy they made you forget painful days leading up to them. There will be high points that make us look back at today, and we’ll be amazed at all the happiness we still had that we couldn’t have predicted.

Don’t you dare give up on tomorrow. Don’t you dare put up with all these low points just to get off the ride at the bottom. Don’t cheat yourself out of all the high points you have left. **You didn’t foresee the happiest points in your life so far, and there’s no reason you could predict the high points you have remaining.**

When you have hard days I need you to see them as what they are: a speedbump. They’re not a cliff, not an explosion, and not the end of the world. They hurt and your feelings are justified, but the pain today is one minor chord in a complex melody. There’s major chords too and we’ll hear a lot of both before the end of the song. The minor might be really loud right now and it might be all we can hear, but hold on. 

I need you to look today in the eyes and say: 

>You’re kind of a dick but you’re not the only day in my life. There’s other days that I’ll enjoy more after you. Just because pain is all I feel now doesn’t mean that’s all I’m ever going to feel.

You don’t have to feel okay to keep going. You don’t have to see the summit to keep climbing. Even if all you feel is pain and all you see is darkness you can keep swimming. We know land is out there and we know it’s not here, so we’re not going to give up in our darkest moment. I'm going to keep swimming, are you?

\----

Further reading: If this resonated with you then I highly recommend **The Book of Joy – Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu.** This is the most approachable book I’ve found that admits how hard life is while still offering simple concrete things we can do to feel better. If you can get the audiobook it’s incredible because the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu are really good friends and hearing them tease and joke with each other and share wisdom is as beautiful as it is helpful. It helped me find way more joy in good times as well as hard times.",False,0.77,

A quarter-life crisis is far more common that you’d think. Almost 75% of 25-33 year olds go through tons of stress and anxiety about understanding who they really are. I kinda feel like I’m still working my way through it too. There is pressure to figure out what you want out of life and fear that anything you’re working towards will not work out.

As I’ve navigated this for myself, I’ve discovered that having perspective, and doing some introspection into what fulfills me has allowed me to channel my energy in the right places. I break this down so much more here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c43MY3xxaVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c43MY3xxaVA).

It's easy to get down on yourself, and think, I'm failing because I'm just bad at this. I'm failing because I am not enough. I'm failing because everyone else is better at this than me.

Each week, we take on a physical challenge together, and whenever someone in the group achieves a new milestone (in any area of life), they share it as a receipt together with a short story to help others.

It's been amazing to multiply momentum together: one of us went from no movement since the lockdown to doing 100 burpees each morning…I went back to running and was able to run a half marathon within weeks. The shared energy is amazing!

For those that don't know, talking to the duck one way that a programmer can attempt to fix an issue that they are having trouble with. They do this, quite literally, by talking to a rubber duck. They state what the problem they're trying to solve is, what the steps they've done are, and what steps are left. They go through the steps they've done into the steps that aren't working, explaining all of it out loud, to a rubber duck sitting on their desk. This helps because it makes you listen to and think about what you're saying, and it can help you resolve issues you may be having. I've bent the traditional programming duck conversation to apply more to r/geMotivated but I think this can be really helpful for some. 

Once you've given your life story to the duck, and you've reached your problem, talk to the duck about what you want to do to fix it. What steps do you want to take, what steps have you tried, what steps can you try differently? Tell the duck. Explore your options. Maybe you want to build a bed? Why haven't you? Have you started and not stopped? Did you get sidetracked? Did you run out of time? Did you never have enough time? Tell the duck. Let it know all your problems with why that bed isn't built. Start exploring how you can solve any of those things, and tell it all to the duck. Maybe you need to do some research on beds. Maybe you need to buy some wood. Maybe you need to schedule some time to work on the bed. Maybe you need a friend to come over and help. Tell the duck. Let it know it all. 

At the end of this, if it helps, you can promise the duck that you'll build that bed. It may not seem like much, but this creates the idea in your mind that you are doing it for the duck and not yourself, and you wouldn't want to let that duck down. This part is effective I think because, like roombas, humans love to become attached to inanimate objects.

At the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked pot always arrived half full.

The poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do. After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the water-bearer one day by the stream:
‘I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologise to you. I have been able to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your house. Because of my flaws, you have to do all of this work, and you don’t get full value from your efforts.’

The bearer said to the pot, ‘Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path, but not on the other pot’s side? That’s because I have always known about your flaw, and I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back, you’ve watered them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the table. Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this beauty to grace the house.’

We all have grand dreams, we all want to succeed in every single area of life, make ton of money, be rich, famous etc. but how many of us are getting what we want? Think about it for a moment.

People are afraid of trying something new (or taking action) because they think they might fail. And they think if they fail then others will laugh at them. People are afraid of speaking in public, and interacting with other people. Reason? Fear of being judged by other people. People don't feel comfortable expressing their views and opinion. Reason?

You must continuously strive to become the best in your field to achieve great things. All of this puts you in a frantic quest for success.

In order to succeed, you will read countless books on personal development and the success of great people in this world. All of these books will explain how to become a better version of yourself to be more productive and effective.

You will apply all the advice from these books to the letter. Your desire to succeed is such that you will do anything to achieve your goals. You will build a routine of good habits recommended by Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, or Bill Gates.

Aware that you get nothing for nothing, you will not count your hours. If you are resilient and strong-willed, you will sooner or later achieve great things in your field.

The day you reach your greatest goals, or on the road to achieving them, you may find that you are missing something essential in your life.

The problem is simple: you have spent so much time trying to succeed at all costs that you have forgotten the essential things in life. You have forgotten that being truly happy is something even more important than anything you can accomplish in the professional world.

Rather than wasting years before you realize this, I think you should adopt 6 principles that will make you happier:

1. Accept yourself as you are
2. Accept others as they are
3. Don’t be your harshest judge
4. Forgive yourself
5. Open up to others
6. Smile to life

**Conclusion**

Success in life is an important thing. Becoming the best version of yourself, while being as productive as possible, is a noble quest that will undoubtedly lead you to the great successes you aspire to.

Nevertheless, being happy is an even more important thing that you need to fight for as early as possible in your life. By adopting today the 6 principles I have just detailed, you will see immediate changes in your life.

If you succeed, you will be able to lead a fulfilled life. It is a beautiful challenge that I commit you to take up every day.

I give you more details on these 6 principles just here: [**https://medium.com/the-post-grad-survival-guide/being-happy-is-within-your-reach-by-adopting-these-6-principles-e082243a20ad?source=friends\_link&sk=a21ef690c0321046b3cda18e936f17de**](https://medium.com/the-post-grad-survival-guide/being-happy-is-within-your-reach-by-adopting-these-6-principles-e082243a20ad?source=friends_link&sk=a21ef690c0321046b3cda18e936f17de)

I think a lot of us get these moments when you want to do a particular thing, for example: paint something, repot one of the plants, read a book, go to a garage, do a puzzle, even play video games, etc., but once you sit down with it you get an emotion that kind of pushes you away, you feel like you don't want to do it anymore.

hgbf0v,webcook22,YSK your outdoor cat is causing detrimental damage to the environment,1593190867.0,,1593213159.0,False,True,False,t3_hgbf0v,4025,False,36334,"Cats hunt down endangered birds and small mammals while they’re outdoors, and have become one of the largest risk to these species due to an over abundance of outdoor domestic cats and feral cats. Please reconsider having an outdoor cat because they are putting many animals onto the endangered list.

Edit to include because people have decided to put their personal feeling towards cats ahead of facts: the American Bird Conservancy has listed outdoor cats as the number one threat to bird species and they have caused about 63 extinctions of birds, mammals, and reptiles. Cats kill about 2.4 billion birds a year. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists cats as one of the worlds worst non-native invasive species.

If you want your cat to go outside, put it on a leash with a harness! That way you can monitor your cat and prevent it from hunting anything. Even if you don’t see it happen, they can still kill while you’re not watching them. A bell on their collar does not help very much to reduce their hunting effectiveness, as they learn to hunt around the bell. 

Also: indoor cats live much longer, healthier lives than outdoor cats! It keeps them from eating things they shouldn’t, getting hit by cars, running away, or other things that put them in danger

I love how a lot of people commenting are talking about a bunch of the things that humans do to damage the environment, as if my post is blaming all environmental issues on cats. Environmental issues are multifaceted and need to be addressed in a variety of ways to ensure proper remediation. One of these ways is to take proper precautions with your cats. I love cats! I’ve had cats before and we ensured that they got lots of exercise and were taken outside while on harnesses or within a fenced yard that we can monitor them in and they can’t get out of. You’re acting like we don’t take the same precautions with dogs, even though dogs are able to be trained much more effectively than cats are.

I’m not sure why people are thinking that my personal feelings are invading this post when I haven’t posted anything about my personal feelings towards this issue.

Calling ahead on they day the store does their orders not only guarantees that we'll have all the product you need, but most of the time we're allowed to give discounts for high volume purchases. On top of that, it makes us happy as well because not only are you happy, but so are all the other customers that come looking for that product because it didn't get entirely cleared out.


For more context, my store had been plagued by a serial Gatorade ""bandit"" ( he wasn't stealing) and was constantly clearing us out. What made it worse is he'd come when there was a wicked good deal and just before the weekend so we'd get screwed on stock and many many unhappy customers. But this guy also wasn't consistent so we couldn't just load up to anticipate the Gatorbandit every time it was on sale.


Then by some miracle we finally crossed paths. I saw him and his partner in crime loading up shopping carts. I told him I i could order what he needed and I did. I ended up ordering over 600 bottles of Gatorade. 600. I gave them to him for a buck (CAD) each, less than half price, and we've been doing it ever since. 


Now, you might not be able to get a huge discount like that as it's really based on how much the store can profit (sold the Gatorade for a buck each, store probably paid half that. The mark up on that kind of stuff is INSANE), BUT you'll definitely pay less than smash and grabbing and leaving the shelf a barren wasteland where all my hopes and dreams go to die.

Dog is super bloated, walks 5 minutes and gets tired, sleeps all day, eats like he's starving, third eyelid is always showing, bumps all over his body, hair so thin I start seeing his skin (he's always had this amazing coat around his neck that made him look royal.)

The symptoms of CPTSD usually include those of PTSD, plus an additional set of symptoms.

### Symptoms of PTSD

#### Reliving the traumatic experience

This can include having nightmares or flashbacks.

#### Avoiding certain situations

You  might avoid situations or activities, such as large crowds or driving,  that remind you of the traumatic event. This also includes keeping  yourself preoccupied to avoid thinking about the event.

#### Changes in beliefs and feelings about yourself and others

This  can include avoiding relationships with other people, not being able to  trust others, or believing the world is very dangerous.

#### Hyperarousal

[Hyperarousal](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/hyperarousal)  refers to constantly being on-alert or jittery. For example, you might  have a hard time sleeping or concentrating. You might also be unusually  startled by loud or unexpected noises.

#### Somatic symptoms

These  refer to physical symptoms that don’t have any underlying medical  cause. For example, when something reminds you of the traumatic event,  you might feel dizzy or nauseated.

### Symptoms of CPTSD

People with CPTSD typically have the above PTSD symptoms along with additional symptoms, including:

#### Lack of emotional regulation

This refers to having [uncontrollable feelings](https://www.healthline.com/symptom/unable-to-control-emotions), such as explosive anger or ongoing sadness.

#### Changes in consciousness

This  can include forgetting the traumatic event or feeling detached from  your emotions or body, which is also called dissociation.

#### Negative self-perception

You may feel [guilt](https://www.healthline.com/symptom/guilt) or shame, to the point that you feel completely different from other people.

#### Difficulty with relationships

You  might find yourself avoiding relationships with other people out of  mistrust or a feeling of not knowing how to interact with others. On the  other hand, some might seek relationships with people who harm them  because it feels familiar.

#### Distorted perception of abuser

This  includes becoming preoccupied with the relationship between you and  your abuser. It can also include preoccupation with revenge or giving  your abuser complete power over your life.

#### Loss of systems of meanings

Systems  of meaning refer to your religion or beliefs about the world. For  example, you might lose faith in some long-held beliefs you had or  develop a strong sense of despair or hopelessness about the world.

It’s  important to note that symptoms of both PTSD and CPTSD can vary widely  between people, and even within one person over time. For example, you  might find yourself avoiding social situations for a period of time,  only to start seeking potentially dangerous situations months or years  later.

If you’re close to someone with CPTSD, it’s also important  to remember that their thoughts and beliefs might not always match up  with their emotions. They might know that, logically, they should avoid  their abuser. However, they might also hold onto a sense of affection  toward them.

Learned how to make chili three years ago, and while I’m not iron chef level, I can always change small things here and there to make it taste different.

Simple soups and salads are great to start, and then you can learn more complex things, like cooking with meats and more powerful spices. Don’t be afraid to experiment, but expect things to go wrong. Making something that isn’t even edible is part of the process - just use a cookbook if you need to get it right. Cooking is all about learning ingredients and flavors, and filling up a meal with different flavors - don’t copy what you see on shows, modify them to your tastes. 

Plus, there is nothing better than a hand-cooked meal. It’s more fun, healthier and cheaper than just making sandwiches all the time, or buying premade food. Not to mention that everyone will fucking love you. People love food, and even if it’s not impressive, they will still appreciate it.

[Source Worldwide](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight)

With more and more people being overweight or obese the perception of a ""normal"" weight is distorted. You can begin to think ""I'm not fat because there are plenty of people fatter than me!"" Don't let this happen to you!

It is often joked that Americans are fat ones but it is time to wake up. We are all getting fat and it is a health disaster. 
Even children are becoming obese in rising amounts.

Being overweight and especially obese greatly raises the risk of a whole host of medical conditions especially diabetes and heart/circulatory problems. This is just as dangerous if not more dangerous to your health than smoking. I can not state this enough; being fat will significantly shorten your life, no ifs or buts, you WILL die younger!

Please take a step on the scales. Is your BMI above 25? Unless you are a professional body builder or strength based athlete you are fat! Have your family do the same, you are only hurting them in the long run by not telling them. If you have children please make sure they don't get fat. The emotional toll it takes on a child and their confidence can be just as damaging as the physical effects.

Burn more calories than you consume. That's all you have to do to return to a healthy weight. You don't have to sign up for an expensive gym membership or some diet service.

Walk or cycle to work if you can. 
Go for a jog on an evening.

Don't do that, that can go wrong in so many ways and makes breaking ribs much more likely when you don't need to do it that aggressively. Don't get me wrong, we've probably all seen people do this in real life as well, but even though it works, doing it properly to minimise injury is the best way to go about it, follow these steps:

1. If you see someone choking, they will immediately panic and grasp for air. Calmly walk over to them and ask them if they're choking, it's obvious, but it will only take a second and they can just nod to say yes. If they're talking, then yeah, they're not choking.
2. Tell them that you're going to help them by performing the maneuver and they will have a few sharp smacks on the back.
3. Make sure they're standing then hold out you arm underneath their chest for them to lean over slightly and give them a sharp smack, right in between the shoulders, the number has changed over the years, but I think 5 is a solid way to go. Also MAKE SURE you are checking after each smack, look over each time to see if it's worked, you don't want to continue smacking someone unnecessarily
4. Now the magic happens. Stand firmly behind them with your legs spread evenly to maintain your stance and ball up a fist in your right hand. Hold this just underneath their rib cage, basically where you would think slightly above where their belly button would be. This is when we thrust and make sure you put some gusto into it. Again, CHECK AFTER EVERY THRUST, this is where things go wrong and where the movies start to get dramatic. ""HUR! HUR! HUR!"" No, no, no. One at a time is fine. You can still cause some injury, fractured or broken ribs being a common one. Something people don't know is at the bottom of your rib cage, the centre bone has a little sharp tip that can come off and has been known to cause some damage.
5. Finally the food has come out and the person is breathing, it's important that they don't immediately sit back down, or if they do, get them to sit on a chair backwards so they can hold onto the back with their arms, obviously don't let them lay on the chest. Reassure them, try to get them back to a regular breathing rate and finally advice them to go to the hospital immediately, doesn't matter if you didn't break anything, it's a must. They will probably do an X-Ray.

Following these steps will help you a lot and can reduce the rate of injury. Personally I think First Aid should be taught in schools as a must, but if you can do yourself a favour and educate yourself, worst case scenario, you can give someone a fighting chance to live in this kind of situation.

hfu3kp,opgary,YSK How to Tell a Sociopath from a Psychopath,1593118925.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hfu3kp,7,False,18," 

[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/wicked-deeds/201401/how-tell-sociopath-psychopath?page=1](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/wicked-deeds/201401/how-tell-sociopath-psychopath?page=1)

Sociopaths tend to be nervous and easily agitated. They are volatile and prone to emotional outbursts, including fits of rage. They are likely to be uneducated and live on the fringes of society, unable to hold down a steady job or stay in one place for long. It is difficult but not impossible for sociopaths to form attachments with others. Many sociopaths are able to form an attachment to a particular individual or group, although they have no regard for society in general or its rules. In the eyes of others, sociopaths will appear to be very disturbed. Any crimes committed by a sociopath, including murder, will tend to be haphazard, disorganized and spontaneous rather than planned.

Psychopaths, on the other hand, are unable to form emotional attachments or feel real empathy with others, although they often have disarming or even charming personalities. Psychopaths are extremely manipulative and can easily gain people’s trust. They learn to mimic emotions, despite their inability to actually feel them and will appear normal to unsuspecting people. Psychopaths are often well educated and hold steady jobs. Some are so good at manipulation and mimicry that they have families and other long-term relationships without those around them ever suspecting their true nature.",False,0.72,Health & Sciences

For years, every month or two I’ll get an episode of what feels like excruciating nerve pain that... well, feels like it’s in and around my butthole. It lasts for about 15 minutes and then completely disappears. Never seen a doctor for it because it happens uncommonly and is so brief, but the pain is really severe and I had started to wonder if I had a problem with the bottom of my spine (corresponding to the nerves that provide sensation to that area).

After an episode of this yesterday, I decided to figure this out for myself. After a little googling around, I found an almost perfect description of the experience: [proctalgia fugax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proctalgia_fugax). It turns out that this is due to a spasm of the levator ani muscle and does not appear to be dangerous or progressive. There’s not much treatment for it either, but my fears that something more serious was going on were relieved.

I found it interesting that they estimate this to be fairly common, but with only 1/5 asking a doctor about it, so I decided to share this with anyone on YSK who has experienced this and wondered about it!

The police have no duty to protect you or anyone else - they are **only required to enforce the law** and from Deshaney to Gonzalez to Parkland, they have gotten the Supreme Court to agree multiple times. 

**Protect yourself, they will not**. Memorize your rights.

In 2005, the Supreme Court ruled that the police could not be sued for failing to enforce a restraining order. Back in 1999, in a Colorado town called Castle Rock, a woman named Jessica Gonzales filed a restraining order against her estranged husband, Simon, who was stalking her. He via permanent protective order was ordered to stay 100 yards away from her and their children outside of visitation. On June 4, 1999, Jessica called police to report Simon had taken their daughters from the front yard. She called four times before she went down to the station in person. The police declined to act. Simon later arrived at the police station himself. He was killed in a shootout with police and the bodies of all three girls were found in his truck. Jessica Gonzales sued the town for the police failing to enforce the restraining order, the case went all the way to the US Supreme Court, who ruled that the police had no obligation to protect the girls from domestic violence and no inherent need to  intervene. She was denied the ability to sue as it was ruled she had no constitutional right to the enforcement of her restraining order and that police departments could not be sued for improper enforcement of such orders, because enforcement of a restraining order does not constitute a property right.

They do not feel they are there to protect you, me or anyone else. DO NOT COUNT ON THIS. They are there to enforce and that is it. This is why they continually use *force*.

So many people think of Chernobyl when asked about radioactivity and immediately relate that extreme event to smoke alarms, which is illogical.

Inside the smoke alarm, the radioactive source is something like Americinium-141 which can last for up to 150 years in one smoke alarm. It is the key to detecting smoke and saving your life. It decays and gives off alpha rays, which are so weak that they can't even penetrate paper. To add to this, companies add paper inside a chamber of the alarm so that the alpha rays can not go through it. Even if they do manage to go past, the alpha rays can not pass through your skin and pose no threat. You will not develop cancer or anything from it. Remember, smoke alarms or there to save your life, not destroy it. They have saved millions of lives since they were made lawful in the 1960s.

Now, you may go to YouTube to find what you can do. As soon as you search exercises to strength train, you will be flooded with videos that have the titles similar to, getting six pacs in two weeks, get a bigger bum in just a week, tone up your belly, etc. In those videos, you will find the trainer doing simple bodyweight exercises with no added weight.

But don't celebrites lose weight, and gain muscle super quickly? Yeah, they do. Because it is literally their job to look a certain way.

Dense breasts can also trigger false positives in mammograms.

hewyam,cpuoverclocker64,YSK Supermoons are not actually a thing.,1592985418.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hewyam,14,False,18,"I'm not sure how the hype train got rolling, but there's absolutely nothing special about what the media calls a ""Supermoon"". As would be expected for a celestial body, the moon's orbit is elliptical, so the distance between it and Earth varies depending on where it is in its orbit. More or less, the full extent of that range is experienced *every single month* and all the so called ""Supermoon"" is is that the full moon so happens to occur around the same time the moon is closest to Earth (called the perigee).

""So it is real!""... NO. The difference in apparent diameter on Earth between the moon at its closest and furthest is ~12%or so, and that's between the extremes. The difference between either of those extremes and the average apparent diameter is small enough to be completely unnoticeable to any layperson.

Compound that with how wildly different the moon can appear just because of optical illusions and how high in the sky it appears and you can treat the whole supermoon thing as a joke.

So why is it important that you know this? Well that comes down to keeping the ""pseudo"" out of our science. The whole concept is catering to injecting the field of astronomy with myth, mysticism, and conspiracy. No, seriously. The guy that coined the term actually referred to himself as an ""astrologer"", aka a whack job. Please contrast this with an *astronomer*, which is an actual scientific pursuit. 

Just as homeopathy and faith healing poison the field of medicine and actual people die as a result, trying to cram astrology into astronomy damages its legitimacy and holds back the progress of our entire species.

TL/DR if you think you saw something special and unique during any so-called ""supermoon"", that shit is all in your head.

i.e. is shorthand for the Latin phrase ""*id est""* which means ""that is"". It is used to provide further clarification on an earlier statement. For example:

""The best way to go viral is to post something contentious, i.e. something that might get people arguing.""

e.g., on the other hand, is shorthand for the Latin phrase ""*exempli gratia""* which means ""for example"". It is used before an item or list of items that stand as an example of what you're writing about. For example:

""The best way to go viral is to post something contentious, e.g. macaroni and cheese is an abomination.""

Please note that the contentious opinion is not necessarily my own.

The way I remember is that i.e. = *in essence,* and e.g. = *example given.*

So, if your boss writes something like ""I want you to move the stuff out of the storeroom i.e. brooms, buckets and cleaning products"" you would only be correct if you moved the items listed.

While we’re providing a few minutes of entertainment, they meet with an enormous amount of frustration. They can never be successful.

After playing like this, dogs can easily become obsessed over lights, reflections, and even shadows. This type of OCD behavior is based on their frustration. It also seems to change the neurology of the brain. Dogs become obsessed over reflections. They may chase everything from your watch on the wall or light shining through glass doors. They are constantly on the lookout for anything that is similarly reflective.

The constant watchfulness becomes a neurotic and obsessive behavior, and a very unhappy way of being. I have also read that it is difficult, if not impossible, to reverse. Something gets switched on in the brain and becomes perpetual.

High-energy dogs and dogs with high prey drive are more susceptible to this condition. However, it can happen in all dogs. I read about a home consultation with five dogs in the household. The family had been using a laser pointer as an outlet for perceived exercise for the entire pack. Four of the five dogs were suffering from the syndrome.

EDIT, from what people have said it clearly can affect cats too, maybe not to the same extent but it's clearly still a big no-no.

Nearly 90% of halitosis cases originate in the mouth ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11905111/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11905111/)), and 80-90% of these originate in the tongue ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11905111/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11905111/)).

Some habits are directly associated with coating formation, such as consuming alcohol, smoking and not drinking enough water ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11905111/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11905111/)). However, some people are genetically predisposed to form it anyway, so cleaning the tongue is the easiest way to solve the problem ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25622725/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25622725/)).

Many people don't clean their tongues properly, because it is not an easy task with a regular toothbrush. However, this can be easily done with a tongue scraper or, if you don't have one, with a tea spoon. Just add it to your routine and you should be fine. ~~For best results, use mouthwash afterwards if you aren't already.~~ Edit: disputed. The least I can affirm for now is that you should avoid mouthwashers that aren't alcohol-free. I will look into it and then edit this part accordingly.

Edit: bad breath and a white coating can have different etiologies, and I am just referring to a common source of bad breath and a common form of white coating associated with this symptom.

I cant emphasize this enough, i truly hope more people can see this because it is a very serious issue, everyday, someone is committing suicide due to negative remarks made by others, who sometimes dont even know that their remarks hurt.

Instead of judging others with skin conditions like acne, eczema and thinking that they do not take care of their skin or that they are dirty, you should pay less attention to their skin condition and treat them normally.

Trust me when i say this, it might seem like a harmless comment to ask,""Do you even wash your face?"" Or ""i recommend you to use a mask/drink more water etc."" but it is very, VERY hurtful to the person and he/she might recall those exact words and feel like shit from time to time. It bothers the person and it hurts a lot. You will never know the feeling if you lived your life having perfect skin.

People with skin conditions are already insecure about how they look and constantly look for many methods to treat their condition, but it all boils down to genetics/hormones for some people which they have no control over, especially males who cant simply take pills. They do not like your advice/your comments because theyve done everything they could. They probably know more about how to care for their skin than you.

💎Key lesson💎
*Practice having social intelligence, treat the person normally and appreciate them, do not simply judge especially if you havent experienced their conditions personally. Learn how to truly empathize.
This is a very important skill which makes other people like you more.
This doesnt only apply for skin conditions, it applies to everything else. Just because youre skinny doesnt mean you can judge the overweight person and think that he/she is a greedy and lazy person.*

Please, this is a very essential skill to have, to learn and understand that others have reasons which you may not think of because you have not experienced their conditions first-hand. An insensitive remark can destroy a person's self esteem for good. 

I can say this because someone gave me a negative remark, months after that i still think of it and feel like shit, it is devastating.

hcpb3h,entropy_koala,YSK the easy mental math to convert km to miles and Celsius to Fahrenheit for Americans when metric units are used.,1592671121.0,,1592679790.0,False,True,False,t3_hcpb3h,34,False,111,"Edit: this information was meant for Americans to use, not for others to accommodate Americans.

The mathematical formula for kilometers to miles is 1.60934 km per mile (the 9.34 meters are negligible in almost all circumstances so I will go with 1.6 for my maths). Breaking it down to fractions, this is 8/5 km is 1 mile. This means for every kilometer, there are 5/8 of a mile. 

**An easy way to get 5/8 of any number is to divide it by 2, then add 25% of that number to it.**

Example: 200km/2=100; 100/4=25; 100+25=125 miles.

The mathematical formula for Celsius to Fahrenheit is F=(9/5C)+32. 

**An easy way to get 9/5 of any number is by multiplying it by 2, then multiplying by .90 of that number (or subtracting 10%).** From there, you just need to add 32 to get Fahrenheit.

Example: 25C*2=50; 50 * .90=45; 45+32=77F.

The descriptions are the same as the formulas but with simplified calculations which is easier to think of than trying to take 5/8 or 9/5 of a number during mental maths.

The inverse of km to miles is also easy by multiplying the miles by .80 (or just subtract one fifth) then multiply by 2. The inverse of Celsius to Fahrenheit is trickier because you need to subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit, then multiply that by 1/9 to be able to divide by 2 for the Celsius.",False,0.87,Education

hcpmub,bpk68,YSK a large portion of dog problems can be caused by lack of exercise and poor training during puppy-hood,1592672262.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hcpmub,5,False,49,"So, straight out of the gates I'll be upfront that I'm not a professional, or even semi-professional dog trainer or psychologist. However, I do have training in both.

If you're a fan of problem dog shows such as The Dog Whisperer, or It's Me or the Dog, or Dog's Behaving Badly (UK show), you'll see very familiar, common issues among them, whether you agree with the individual shows' hosts' methods and approaches.

But you should know (if you don't already) that regular exercise throughout their life and key training when a dog is very young, are valuable combatants in keeping your dogs happy, healthy and well behaved.

Sounds obvious, but there are a lot of people who don't take either on board.

**To the first point - exercise.**

All dogs need exercise, just like us, just like any animal. Some need more than others, but *all* of them need regular exercise, even if it's 20-30 mins of a good walk around your neighbourhood.

You can get away, so to speak, with less exercise for some breeds (like King Charles Spaniels) and certainly for old(er) dogs. Then there are quite adaptable breeds such as Labradors or Cocker Spaniels who, whilst perfectly capable of staying outside working on a farm all day, will happily settle for less.

However, lack of exercise can be a huge factor in a lot of common dog problems such as boisterousness, destruction, poor manners and some aggressive tenancies.

This is most evident in super high-energy breeds like terriers, Boxers and Sheep Dogs. Don't exercise a Boxer enough and you'll often be thanked with chewed up couches, floors, and anything they can munch.

Put it this way: see how stir crazy everyone's gotten over the last few months by not being out and about? That's how a dog feels when cooped up all the time :)

**To the second point - puppy-hood.**

Puppies are cute and fun and have a weird flip-flop of endless energy and then sudden narcolepsy. But, a lot of their behaviour in adulthood stems from what they do (or are allowed to do) now, when they're a puppy.

Take jumping up as an example. Most puppies are small and having one jump up, even just putting their front paws on your legs, is a relatively trivial. However, if you let this continue with, say a Labrador, then when they're suddenly a 35Kg (70-80lb) large male dog, this is a problem.

Food aggression is another common issue. Dogs shouldn't be pestered when they're eating, but there are times when you have to interfere with them: maybe they've got hold of something that's dangerous for them; maybe you just need to reach over them to grab something on a shelf. You shouldn't expect to have them attack you or get aggressive.

One way to mitigate this is to feed them from a bowl using your hand, or make them wait before letting them eat their food. Or, as we used to do, let them eat a bit and then take their bowls up, wait a beat and put them back down. You don't have to do it a lot, or all the time, but when you *need* to, it'll be easier if you put this sort of training in when they're a puppy and a) won't object as much, and b) can't really cause you any harm if they did.

&#x200B;

PS - yes, there are lots of factors in dogs' behaviours and these two factors aren't the be all and end all, but they are often common contributing factors to problem behaviours.

PPS - I'm also aware that many people adopt dogs later in their lives and don't have access to a time machine to address problems from their puppy years. However, if you do have a puppy, then make sure to take your training outside of the common 'sit', 'stay', 'drop' stuff.

hbipx2,southwoodhunter,YSK: How to actually escape a rear naked choke.,1592500112.0,,1592570834.0,False,True,False,t3_hbipx2,378,False,11926,"There's a video on the front page *right now* of a young man showing how to escape a ""choke hold"". Although I'm sure he's very well intentioned, the advice given will get you seriously hurt.

I'm a BJJ Blue Belt. Tonight when I go train, I'm going to film a video with one of the Brown Belts or Black Belt Coaches and upload it. But I wanted to provide a text explanation of how to properly do it, as well as why his video is incorrect.

Firstly, here is one correct way to escape:

1) Place both hands on the choking arm.
2) Simultaneously drop your hips low (like a squat) and pull down on the arm.
3) Keep hold of the arm and place your hips below the hips of your assailant
4) lift up, and turn *away* from the choke (away from the point of the elbow) bringing the arm with you.
For bonus points: drop to your knees as you turn.

This will throw your attacker *hard* into the ground.

The Rear Naked Choke is incredibly easy to defend against while standing. On the ground, not as easy.

Your primary goal is to get the attacking arm *away* from your soft bits e.g. neck and face.

A properly applied Rear Naked Choke is a *blood choke* (meaning that it cuts off your blood supply to your brain) and not an attempt to crush your esophagus.

Once sunk in, you have about 6-10 seconds before you pass out.

Here's why the video is dangerous and inaccurate:

In the video, the attackers non-choking arm is shown to be under the defenders arm. In reality, that arm will be above your shoulder and pressure will be applied to the back of your head.

The video suggests tucking your chin. All this will result in is broken teeth or a broken jaw. Do not tuck your chin untill you have secured the attacking arm.

The video suggests turning into the point of the elbow. This is the *opposite* of what you want. You want to turn toward the hand - *away* from the choke.

The video suggest taking your hand off the choking arm to attack the leg. Do not do this. Keep both hands on the attacking arm until you have removed it or thrown your attacker.

Finally, this advice is assuming you are *already being choked*. Your #1 self defense is Run-Fu. 

Don't get into fights. Dont get put in that position in the first place. I know that sound like ""of course, why didn't I think of that"". But your mindset needs to be to *not emgage* first, and escape effectively second.

Bad self defense advice is *dangerous*.

Please research the subject yourself from reputable sources. BJJ practitioners are your best best.

Don't think that watching one video or taking a couple self defense seminars is going to do a *damn thing*. It will not. I have trained for thousands of hours and would still do *everything in my power* not to fight in a self defense situation.

If you are in a life threatening situation, at the very least, you should know the *correct* way to defend yourself.

Begging the question actually comes from rhetoric and philosophy and should only be used when someone uses circular logic to support a claim, or uses their conclusion as support for said conclusion. For example: Her shoes were ugly because they didn’t look good, or We should sleep eight hours a night because a healthy routine requires lots of sleep. 

With this phrase, **the question that is always being begged is “WHY is X so?”** Why don’t the shoes look good, why is sleep important?

hblbtj,WanderingVirginia,YSK: Paint and Primer serve radically different purposes and cannot be reasonably combined. Paint and Primer guarantees a flimsy finish that will fault quickly.,1592508965.0,,1592510458.0,False,True,False,t3_hblbtj,21,False,132,"
Edit: the title should say paint and primer in one combination guarantees a flimsy result. Doh.

Primer is an adhesive, and the most important step in any paint finish. The binding agents that make it a good adhesive also radically soften it. Pure paint is extremely hard but adheres poorly. Putting enough primer binders into the paint to make it adhere guarantees it will be soft and wear quickly. Failing to add binders or use primer guarantees flake off quickly. The best, most expensive, most scammy paint and primer combos generally last two years, five if you are lucky In low traffic areas. The cheapest primer then paint sequence, properly applied, will wear two decades plus in high traffic areas.

After five years in high end interior refinishing, this is one of my biggest pet peeves. If a contractor finishes your shit with a paint primer in one combo, they don't have any pride in the durability of their work. Most generals I know will fire a painter on the spot for showing up with a paint and primer in one. If you actually care about the long term finish quality, there is no substitute.

hateul,hilfigertout,"YSK when trying to change someone else's mind, there are three argument styles to use. Which one is most effective depends on how the other person came to their beliefs.",1592407844.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_hateul,68,False,2622,"When you come up against someone who believes something different than you, and you want to try and talk them out of their belief, it’s important to realize they likely came to their viewpoint on the topic differently than you came to yours. There are three main ways people come to beliefs, and as such there are three main ways you can go about arguing against them. **People come to believe certain things by logic, authority, or values. To give a convincing argument, you need to base it on the same thing: logic, authority, or values.** 

**Logic:**

This is the easiest one to argue against. When you present a group of people with a logic puzzle, and then present the solution, nobody generally argues with the solution because everyone started with the same information and can follow the thought process that led to the solution. To try convincing someone out of a viewpoint they arrived at by logic:

* Ask the other person how they came by this belief and try to follow their train of thought. Don’t interrupt, except to ask for clarification.
* Make sure that both of you have the same information to start from. Perhaps there’s something one of you didn’t know that makes the difference.
* Keep track of any assumptions you both are making. If one of the other person’s assumptions about how the world works doesn’t hold up, call it into question. If you’re making an assumption that the other person isn’t making, explain why you think it’s a reasonable one.
* Watch for common [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) in the other person’s argument. (and in your own)

**Authority:**

Like it or not, this is the way most of your beliefs about the world are initially formed. How do we know facts we can’t see like “the Earth goes around the Sun” or “the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell”? Well, we’re told them by an authority on the subject, usually a teacher. This is why people like flat-earthers or anti-vaxxers, who try to dispute beliefs commonly held as facts, start by trying to discredit the authorities. They call into question whether you can trust teachers or researchers. To try convincing someone out of a viewpoint they arrived at by authority:

* First, and most important, get the sources the other person is basing their beliefs on. Preferably, get the source that they feel the strongest tied to, which can very often be their first exposure to the topic. 
   * To get that source, don’t ask the other person to “show me some evidence” or some such. Ask them how they first came by this belief and let them talk about their journey to their viewpoint. They’ll likely bring it up themselves.
* Once you have the sources, ask questions. Why do they trust this source? Are there others they find more reputable? What else have the creators of that source written or said? 
* Identify any potential bias in their source. (ex: Do the writers have any conflicts of interest? Why did they write that article?) Call this into question. 
* If the creators of the source have said or written anything that contradicts that source, bring that up. 
* If asked for your own source, provide one if you can and explain why you believe that authority can be trusted. (If you arrived at your belief through logic or values, providing a source may be difficult.) 
* Do *not* try to force a source the other person doesn’t trust down their throat. In fact, it’s best to wait until the other person asks for a source to even provide one.

**Values:**

This one’s the hardest, as different people have such wildly different values and priorities. As such, trying to change an opinion that’s based on a person’s values can be very tricky if you don’t know how they see the world. They might consider some parts of an issue more or less important than you might. This type of discussion is most likely to lead to an “agree to disagree” scenario. To try convincing someone out of a viewpoint they arrived at by values:

* Ask the other person how they came by this belief and let them tell you the values they hold that led them to their viewpoint. Don’t interrupt, except to ask for clarification. 
* Make your argument based on values the other person holds highly. Do not try to base your argument on something the other person doesn’t care about. (i.e. if someone isn’t religious, any argument involving spirituality will likely fall on deaf ears. If someone doesn’t value fairness very highly, arguments about helping those who are disadvantaged won’t be as effective.)
* Is there another belief or value the other person holds highly that might clash with their view? Bring it up and ask how these thoughts mesh together in their mind.
* If asked, explain your own values on the topic. Try to avoid soapboxing. This discussion should be about the other person's beliefs, not yours.
* As a last resort, call their value into question. Ask the other person why they prioritize one core part of their belief over another. This is not likely to work, as people's values are generally extremely resistant to change, but it gives everyone involved something to think over. 

&#x200B;

There are some common threads to these. In changing someone’s mind, questions are key. Ask for someone else’s viewpoint before giving your own. Asking *how* they came to their view is often better than asking *why* they believe it. Keep in mind how you came to your own belief and how that differs from the other person’s thought process. And, of course, don’t expect them to flip their stance on the spot. Changing someone’s mind takes time and, in the end, you cannot drag someone to a new conclusion. They have to come to it themselves. If you give a convincing argument, you can introduce doubt into their belief and help them on their way to changing their view. That is what success looks like.",False,0.98,Education

The distinction is especially important if you are the one to be taken in.

Jail is a place where people awaiting trial or those who are suspect or committed a minor misdemeanour are held. You can think of jail as temporary confinement so that you do not escape while the case is sorted out. You can be taken to jail by a police officer if you are a suspect of a crime. It doesn't mean that you are guilty. You could also go to jail for minor misdemeanours.

Prison, on the other hand, are much more serious facilities. They are for the one's *convicted* of crime, and you do not go to prison just because you are a suspect. Prison sentences are much longer (more than a year) than the time you spend in jail. You go to prison after your case was heard and the judge ruled you guilty of a crime.

Those two terms are very different, and it is unfortunate that people often misunderstand what it means to go to jail.

It is better to initiate conversation and offer and ear to someone who needs it, for example someone dealing with depression, instead of offering an ear. I see this quite often, where people have good intentions and offer an ear to someone. They say something along the lines of ¨if you ever need to talk, dm me. ¨ or ¨if you ever need to reach out, you know where to find me¨.

BUT ...someone who is in a bad place, especially with depression, usually feels like a burden to others and a waste of space. They wont reach out to you...its not likely. So its best to send them a message, and that makes them feel less like a burden and they will feel appreciated way more. And it will make it way easier for them to talk about things they needed to. Initiating things for someone in a bad place is very difficult.

I say this because I have dealt with depression and whenever i posted online, I didn´t get many reaching out to me directly. I also want to add(and sorry if this comes across as condescending or brash) ,when you offer someone something, truly mean it. Don´t offer it just for internet brownie points.

While not completely the same, knowing one type of CPR could help you greatly if you find yourself in a situation needing the other.

Number 1. Check their breathing/heartbeat. Lay back their head, open mouth, pull out tongue and check for obstruction in throat. Remove obstruction if applicable/possible. If no obstruction, begin CPR.

**PUPPIES/KITTENS ARE DIFFERENT PROCEDURE THAN ADULTS**: secure the pup’s mouth closed with one hand, cup securely around their nose with the other. Exhale gently into their nose for 5-6 seconds (ensure chest rises and falls as you do this). Repeat until breathing restarts.

If no heartbeat, lay pup on its **right** side. Place thumbs and forefingers around pup’s chest right behind front legs. Perform **one compression per second** and repeat breathing into nose every **six seconds**. Continue until pup is breathing or you get to emergency vet.

ADULT PETS:


***For any adult pet scenario below, you will give compressions at the same rate as you would a human, around ~100 compressions/minute or to the beat of “Stayin Alive” by the BeeGees***

You should be aware that this is potentially a very risky move, especially if you do not know much about your network / computer setup to know whether you have other protections such as a software firewall to help protect you.

Plugging your PC directly into the modem bypasses any security features or firewalls built into your router. This means that your computer will be discoverable on the internet to anyone performing network port scans and looking for an easy vulnerability to exploit. By default, most consumer grade routers have features that automatically protect against some of this port scanning, but when your computer is connected directly to the internet, it allows attackers to see a lot more information about your computer and more easily locate and abuse vulnerabilities.

For some reason, Spectrum and other ISPs have begun adding the direct connect step to their automated troubleshooting guides, but most people following these steps do not have the knowledge to protect themselves in this scenario and are not aware that this is a risky move. 

If you are advised to do this to eliminate your router being the source of the problem and absolutely must do so now, try to leave it connected directly for as brief a time as possible and make sure you at least have a software firewall, even Windows Firewall, enabled (although it will still not be ""safe"", just less risky). **Never** leave your computer directly connected to your modem for any significant length of time. If your router is the problem, you need fix or replace it before using your computer to conduct your regular work/business.

ETA: A couple of people have mentioned that this can be safe, but it depends on what kind of modem you have. Some modems essentially have a router built in and you'll likely be okay; this YSK is for people who do not have that type of modem or do not know what they have. As many times as I have heard Level 1 support advise this step, I have never heard of them checking what kind of modem you have first.

#The biggest one actually: 2 day shipping does not mean 2 days from when you order it. 2 day shipping means it takes 2 days from when it ships out for it to be delivered. So if you order something on Monday, but you don’t get it until Saturday, if it shipped out on Thursday it’s still 2 day shipping. 

1. Third party items (items that say “ships from and sold by xxxxxx) have different rules than other items. Any issues with the product, returns, replacements etc must be communicated with the seller first, meaning you have to send an email to the seller. If you call Amazon with an issue about a third party item, they will just send an email. Sellers have 2 business days to respond. Amazon does have an atoz guarantee claim in place though.

2. If the item is not Shipped from and sold by Amazon, more than likely if there’s an item issue (broken, wrong item sent, etc.,) Amazon cannot issue a replacement, only a refund.

3. If your item shows it’s been delivered but you haven’t received it, wait a day to see if it will show up at your doorstep. That’s what customer service will tell you to do anyway. 

4. My friend and I both work at Call centers, so we both deal with surveys. If your customer service rep was friendly, did what they could to help, had nice conversation, or whatever, consider taking the minute to respond to the survey. Try not to respond NO just because you didn’t get your way. There are things that we are not able to do for customers, and hitting NO won’t change that.

Because of the way 22 ammo works, the firing pins of the guns strike the backsiden of the casing at an angle.

If you then try to fire a live round, the casing will not eject because it will be stuck inside. This can cause all sorts of other issues too potentially including damaging the firing pin over time.

Now everybody knows that elite gymnasts require great feats of strength and endurance and require a muscular physique in order to do what they do. Now I believe gymnastics consist mainly of bodyweight excercises and explosive movements with your bodyweight. **Now this suggests one thing- that bodyweight excercises are no joke.** What proves this even more is that alot of those gymnasts get that body through bodyweight excercises and then weighted calisthenics rather than traditional weightlfiting. Even more proof that bodyweight excercises are no joke is that the rings specialists are the biggest of all gymnasts and require to be the biggest of them all in order to compete. Now on the rings you don't do alot of jumping or pushing yourself into the air, instead you lift your bodyweight and hold it. **Now if that much muscle is really required to do that, it shows just how tough bodyweight excercises can be.**

Now lets steer away from the gymnasts and gymnastics for a moment. Now I know alot of people that try calisthenics before weightlifting at all and the results are phenomenal. They seemed to gain alot of muscle mass from doing just bodyweight excercises without any weight. Google calisthenics bodybuilders and you'll see what I mean. Although calisthenics alone isn't enough to reach the maximum amount of muscle you could build, weighted calisthenics might.

Now a bodyweight excercise often targets a bunch of muscles at once including your core. For example a pull-up targets all of the muscles on your arms and back as well as your upper body (not including abs). While sit-ups target your core.

An easy way to test that is take off your shoes and socks and try to stand outside in one spot for an extended period of time, at least 30 seconds. If you can stand there without shoes and socks, so can your dog. Dogs can also suffer from burned paw pads due to the hot concrete.

If you think your dog is suffering from heat stroke, the clearest sign will be lack of movement and/or a dry nose. You should try to take your pet to the nearest pet hospital for treatment.

- Pull off the road as soon as possible and safely.

- Put the car in park and immediately turn on interior lighting (if you're interior lighting doesn't work you can use a head lamp to allow the officer to see in your car)

- Keep your hands on the steering wheel

- If asked for license, registration, or insurance tell them where the items are located.

- I find if you know you're in the wrong (10-15 over) admit it and say your favorite song came on (I always say Bohemian Rhapsody if asked) was playing. 

- invest 15 dollars in light bulbs as extras and if you get pulled over for a brake light tell them you will go to the next auto parts store you see to use their tools.

A good portion of my job is training the employees to the companies we are contracted to. Things like spotting malicious e-mails, social engineering, etc.

One area that everyone seems to think they are great in, but usually aren't, is passwords. One example I do in my training is put up a series of password pairs and ask the audience which password is ""stronger"" (depending on the clientele, I'll go into what hashing is and do demonstrations of cracking). The results always surprise me.

One of our SOC auditors wasn't even aware that NIST had updated their [guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) a few years ago. I think this speaks to how comfortable we all think we are with passwords, *when we really shouldn't be.*

Now a days, your password is the key to your life. There are more malicious actors now than ever, using more sophisticated tools than ever. You should know how you can help protect yourself, starting with password hygiene.

**Password Patterns (Avoid These):**

* 77% of passwords containing a single digit append it to the end of their password. 10% of the time, an appended digit will be a ""1"" (includes data where more than one digit was appended). If the password has capitals, 15% of the time it will be a ""1"" ^(\[2\]). Adding a 1 to the end of your password has become effectively meaningless for your security.
* To clarify the above regarding the 10% figure: The data set has passwords with varying number of digits (""pass123"", ""pass2134325"", ""pass1"", etc.). Of *all* passwords which have *any number* digits appended, 10% of those only append a single ""1"".
* 35% of passwords requiring a capital letter will capitalize the first letter ^(\[2\]).
* 89% of 7-character long alpha strings can be targeted by either capitalizing the first character or capitalizing the whole string^(\[2\]).
* 61% of passwords are the exact length of the minimum length set in the password policy^(\[3\])\*.
* \~10% of users will model their password after their username^(\[3\]). ([john.smith@company.com](mailto:john.smith@company.com):Jsmith1)

**Things to Keep in Mind When Creating a Password:**

* Length is *more important* than complexity^(\[1\]) . This does not mean complexity is not important, just that length is *more* important. Shoot for length first, then complexity.
* Avoid common substitutions, as they are baked into [password cracking rule-sets](https://github.com/praetorian-code/Hob0Rules). Common substitutions include: a = @, i = !, s = $, etc. Same with adding a 1 to the end of your password and capitalizing the first character. These are common patterns, and are well-known to crackers.
* Instead of thinking ""password"" think ""passphrase"". A single dictionary word is extremely bad. Four to five random dictionary words, perhaps separated by spaces or special characters, is robust. *The benefit of a passphrase is that it is easier for you to generate entropy while still remembering your key. Generating entropy through randomized characters is hard, and results in a hard to remember password, meaning you will likely end up with less entropy.*
* Avoid ""password walking"". This is using a password with adjacent keyboard characters (e.g. ""qwerty"", ""1q2w3e4r"", ""1qaz2wsx"", etc.)
* Avoid any password present on a password blacklist^(\[4\]). Ideally, this should be a baked-in process.

**Passwords in General:**

* You should be using a different password for *every* website. At the very least, your e-mail password should be extremely strong and unique. If someone gets into your e-mail, they can simply reset every other password connected to that e-mail, regardless of how strong they are. Password re-use attacks are common^(\[5\]). *I cannot overstate the importance of this one tip.*
* SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) is better than nothing, but [sim-swapping](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/sim-swap-fraud-explained/) has made it inferior to other forms of 2FA and MFA.
* I, and my colleagues, and many others **strongly recommend a** (non-browser-based, audited) **password manager**. There still seems to be debate about password managers. I will only comment that most security professionals and government agencies encourage the use of them^(\[6, 7, 8, 9, 10\]). *They are not a panacea. Use them in combination with other positive security habits, like frequent backups and 2FA/MFA.*

**For developers and/or administrators:**

* Ditch password resets. There is ample evidence now that users change their passwords in predictable patterns (password1 -> password2 -> password3 -> pa$$word1 -> etc.). Additionally, if users know that they will have to change their passwords, they are more likely to create a weaker -- but more memorable -- password. Passwords should only be force-changed at signs of compromise. Overall, effectiveness of password expiration in meeting its intended goal is weak^(\[11\]).
* Drop the complexity song and dance. These restrictions will often force users into following one of the above exposed patterns of password creation, and there is little evidence that they increase password robustness (as they are currently implemented).\*\* The ""inventor"" of password complexity rules has even apologized and admitted there wasn't much empirical data on password security at the time he implemented the rules^(\[12\]).
* Allow paste in password fields. This is less of a problem now, but there are still applications and websites which don't allow pasted passwords. Password managers are more ubiquitous each day. Don't discourage it.
* Check user passwords against an up-to-date blacklist of common/compromised passwords. There are several tools and implementations to accomplish this.

**Tools and Resources:**

* [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is a resource where you enter your e-mail to see if it has appeared in any known breaches catalogued by the website.
* [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/) is a free and open-source software token for 2FA.
* [NIST 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)

\-----------

\* Knowing the minimum length required by policy, and knowing that 61% of passwords are that length will significantly increase the speed of password cracking.

\*\* There is ongoing research into the benefits of having multiple rules in a ""pool"", of which a few are randomly selected to be applied on a user-to-user basis. (e.g. Alice must include a number and be a minimum length of 10 characters. Bob must include a special character and a minimum length of 9 characters).

Recycling is often overprioritized and overused, which may result in a net negative effect on the environment due to shipping processes used.

In reality, recycling is intended to be used as a small part of a larger strategy, referred to as ""reduce reuse recycle"". this is intended as a list of steps/priorities in which recycling comes last. Recycling is last because it is the last resort, and only slightly better than throwing things away. In fact, only 9.1% of plastic sent to be recycled actually gets recycled, the rest is wasted. Before recycling, you should first try to reduce your consumption, reuse what items you can, and if something must be disposed of, see if it can be recycled.

For example:

1. Reduce: Rather than buying a pack of water bottles, only buy one or two reusable ones.
2. Reuse: Once the bottle is empty, fill it up again.
3. Recycle: If the bottle is no longer usable for some reason, recycle it.

Some tips:

1. Durable and long-lasting products are more cost-effective and cleaner (LED bulbs).
2. Maintaining, and replacing small parts is better than replacing an entire device (adding new parts to an old computer). Internet tutorials can help with this stuff.
3. Large containers produce less waste (buying in bulk).

Edit: Other things to take into consideration:

1. Paper and cardboard can often be composted or recycled very effectively, making it a great material for items that must be disposable.
2. Metals are great. Not only can they be reused for long periods of time, they can also be recycled efficiently if needed. Some places may even pay for items such as cans.
3. Reuse often saves money, despite the increased cost upfront. For example, a $6 1000 cycle AA battery, would save you $294 over its lifetime when compared to a 30 cent disposable battery.
4. Selling or donating items such as old electronics ensures that they are reused, and reduces the need for more items to be manufactured.

gzskzb,pangeapedestrian,"YSK that rice works for drying your phone is a myth, and can often be worse than doing nothing.",1591726336.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_gzskzb,12,False,29,"I feel like every other day I see somebody putting their phone in rice.     The theory is that rice absorbs the water, thus saving the phone that's been dropped in the toilet.   While this is technically true, many other materials are absorbent, and an open window with plenty of airflow, next to a fan, etc, will be much more effective at rapid evaporation than being buried in rice- especially if sealed in a plastic bag of rice as most people do.   The only thing you are doing by sticking your phone in rice is adding the risk of damaging ports by gumming them up with rice to your water problem.  


How does water damage happen?   Most of it happens over time.   Water causes corrosion, and corrosion happens faster due to increased oxidation by electric current.   If you've ever had water damaged electronics, you've probably noticed they get worse and worse, before dying entirely.  This is why.  


So generally people stick their phone in rice for a day, turn it on, and hooray! The rice worked!   
Thing is, the water is still in there, and the corrosion has already started.    Most water also has distilled salts, which even after drying, still cause corrosion.  Dropping your phone in the ocean is especially bad for this reason.   So although the phone appears to have been fixed by the rice, the corrosion has only just begun.  



What should you actually do?   Ideally, take apart your phone and clean it, then thoroughly dry it.   Pure isopropyl alcohol is non-conductive and therefore safe, it also evaporates quickly and generally without residue (though some might have additives?  I'm a little unsure on this), and bonds well with most oils as a solvent, so it gives you phone a good cleaning. A soft toothbrush is good for scrubbing down boards.  
You can even use distilled water if you have no iso as long as you dry everything completely before powering on to avoid a short.  Washing out water with all those dissolved salts is still your top priority, and as long as the distilled water dries completely it won't be leaving anything behind.  Dishwasher is not an uncommon solution for cleaning a graphics card believe it or not.  


If you feel uncomfortable taking apart your phone, swishing it around thoroughly in a bath of iso will still go a long way in cleaning your device and displacing any water inside the device, but most phones come apart pretty easy with a screw driver, a suction cup, and a YouTube tutorial.  Believe in yourself. 


Even airdrying in a place with plenty of light and airflow will still be better than sealing your device up in rice and getting rice stuck in all your ports.

gzd0mv,Si-Ran,YSK if you have problems with ants invading your house in the summer that they are attracted to salt way more than they are sugar,1591665975.0,,1591673136.0,False,True,False,t3_gzd0mv,47,False,619,"If your house is like mine and you always have trouble with ants coming in your house during the summer months, it might save you some trouble to know ahead of time that ants LOOOOVE salt. Way more than sugar. This is because salt is much harder to find in nature than sugar is.

One surprising source of salt that ants gravitate to is dirty laundry. Gross, I know, but the salt in our sweat gets soaked in our clothes and they will be all over that shit.

So go ahead and deal with your ant problem now before they discover your hamper!!!!

Edit: I'll just go ahead and add that **the way I always dealt with this was putting a barrier of  diatomaceous  earth** around the inner and outer perimeter of my house (especially along that space where the wall meets the floor). It's cheap, pretty non-toxic, and not smelly. The stuff is safe powder for us, but for ants it's like trying to walk across broken glass, so it's like an impenetrable barrier to them. And any that do walk across it get ded because their bodies fall apart when they walk on it.

Edit 2: Another user pointed out that if you have a recurring problem with ants, you should really just have a pest control person to come out and see where they're coming from so you can solve the problem once and for all. That's probably best advice if you can afford it.

Edit 3: Some sources about the salt thing. Apparently the further you are from the ocean, the more ants will seek out salt. Makes sense, really.

gy3l8h,ToWhistleInTheDark,"YSK that most people incorrectly use the words ""feel,"" and have misgivings about ""feelings"" - but proper understanding and use of these words can help you communicate better, be understood more, and engage with your and others' emotions.",1591494269.0,,1591545940.0,False,True,False,t3_gy3l8h,12,False,49,"I've been in therapy a while now, and one of the biggest things I learned through it is how to be in touch with my emotions. It may sound like ""touchy feely psychobabble,"" but I've learned that emotions are simply part of who I am as a human - along with my thoughts and beliefs.

However, many people use the word ""feel"" inaccurately: ""I feel you are incorrect."" ""I feel this is a bad idea."" In those cases, what's being related is not an actual feeling - but a proposition, a truth statement, couched in ""feelings"" words while actually not being a feeling at all. It's often used to really convey uncertainty, or to soften the blow of a 'tough' statement. That robs us of the ability to express our actual feelings - emotions, such as ""I feel discouraged about getting hours cut at my work because I've always believed my earning potential is tied to my value as a person.""

Sharing emotions in this format, which is also called an IFAB (**I f**eel *<emotion word>* **a**bout *<situation, circumstance, event>* **b**ecause *<belief, meaning made of the situation, thoughts>),* enables you to convey actual feelings, rather than assertions or truth statements. Feelings are incontrovertible - you are subjectively feeling them. You can't will yourself to feel happy, or depressed, or elated, or amused. You can think of things that lead to you feeling them, or do things that lead to you feeling them - but you can't directly manufacture those feelings. So they are an important part of your subjective human experience.

Now, you may feel feelings based on incorrect perceptions, assumptions, meanings you draw from certain circumstances - but the feelings you feel at the end of that process are real. The IFAB format above helps you to (1) identify what it is that you are responding to, that leads to you having that feeling, and (2) identify what thought patterns or beliefs or meanings you make from it, are leading to those feelings.

This helps you to gain self-awareness, the ability to choose to respond differently in the future, and also not to be surprised and side-lined by your emotional responses. When IFABs are shared with others, it lets them into your mind and world, and it also lessens combative responses - because you aren't saying something like ""I feel you're being really pushy,"" making it a ""you"" statement where they are the ""problem"" - instead, you are talking about yourself, your subjective experience, like: ""I feel surprised and defensive about what you asked me to do because I didn't think that was part of my responsibility.""

A tool that can greatly help you identify what you may be feeling, is a ""Feeling Wheel"":[https://www.gottman.com/blog/printable-feeling-wheel/](https://www.gottman.com/blog/printable-feeling-wheel/) (courtesy Dr. Gloria Wilcox)

In the center of the wheel are the ""basic"" emotions - which are actually tertiary emotions, because underneath for example ""mad"" could be something more specific like ""hurt,"" underneath which could be ""jealous."" The more specific you can get, the more useful it is in being self-aware and understanding the situation that elicited that feeling.

The only knowledge I really have on this is what I talked to my psychologist about and what I've read up on. I'll try to keep everything as factual as possible. Also, I use the words disorder and illness interchangeably because I think it's obvious what I mean.

I see a lot of people when casually speaking of mental illnesses treat autism like a taboo. I personally faced this when my psychologist recommended testing for autism and I went ""what? no way, I have ADHD or Tourette's or something, I'm not autistic."" So here's just a semi-quick rundown on things you might want to know a bit more about considering mental health is always a popular topic and I NEVER see people bring autism into the equation when it's involved in basically every ""popular"" disorder.

**RELEVANT HISTORY**

Autism was split into 4 different categories (autistic disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder) until 2013, but then it was changed in the DSM-5 to be a spectrum known as Autism Spectrum Disorder/ASD. An important thing to note is [that ""Asperger's Syndrome"" doesn't exist](https://ibcces.org/blog/2016/06/13/does-aspergers-still-exist/), it was morphed into the spectrum and now is classified under mild ASD (and has always been mild ASD, just under a different name). It really grinds my gears when people desperate to not be autistic try to claim Asperger's as something completely different, and I see this [mistake](https://sv.s-ul.eu/Iomr46p2) made [over](https://sv.s-ul.eu/cpUAs4CD) and [over](https://sv.s-ul.eu/5IChSy6K) again when talking about mental illness (or even worse, taking a psychology-tools.com questionnaire). More on this later.

**WHAT IS ASD, ANYWAYS?**

This spectrum is huge and [could possibly include disorders like](https://www.autismspeaks.org/medical-conditions-associated-autism) OCD, Tourette's, ADHD ([formerly known as ADD](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315158)), anxiety, depression, and many other disorders that lead to social awkwardness and the likes. I say ""could possibly"" because these all have [many overlapping symptoms with autism](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml) and very well can be subjected to misdiagnosis by omittance of autism, but also could very well be diagnosed completely independent of autism. This is very important to know because some people, including the person reading this, may treat these illnesses like a clubhouse where they bond over how ADHD they are but ""definitely aren't"" autistic or ""definitely don't"" have Tourette's when, biologically, these kinds of disorders are very connected with each other. For example, 50% of children with OCD are reported to have tics, [and up to 60% of Tourette's inflicted people have been reported to have OCD-like symptoms](https://iocdf.org/expert-opinions/ocd-and-tourette-syndrome/). Autism and ADHD share [a ton of similarities](https://www.understood.org/en/learning-thinking-differences/child-learning-disabilities/add-adhd/the-difference-between-adhd-and-autism) in their symptoms and [more than half of the people with ASD have symptoms of ADHD](https://chadd.org/about-adhd/adhd-and-autism-spectrum-disorder/). More than [70% of autistic youth](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/the-deep-emotional-ties-between-depression-and-autism/) have other mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety, and people with autism are [much more likely](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-depression-takes-unusual-forms/) to develop depression than a neurotypical person. To put a cherry on top, the ""undiagnosis"" likelihood is estimated to be [two undiagnosed adults](https://journals.lww.com/tnpj/Citation/2018/09000/Identifying_autism_spectrum_disorder_in.3.aspx) for every three that are diagnosed. Doing the basic math, that's an upwards of 40% of autistic adults that never get diagnosed, and I would honestly project it to be more than half (and so would [this guy](https://www.aane.org/prevalence/), I guess).

**OK, GET TO THE POINT**

This happens with pretty much every illness because autism is just one of those things nobody wants to say they have; it almost feels like you should expect somebody to have anxiety, depression, or ADHD (I like to call them the ""Big 3""), but when someone says ""I have mild ASD,"" everyone starts walking on glass and questioning their behavior because it's been 7 years and still, *nobody knows what that means*. This kinda sucks, because to me it would have been SO much easier to have ADHD or depression because at least I don't have to hold a TED talk every time I tell someone I have autism. Given so many people who have these disorders probably have a bit of autism in them too, I think it should be just as common to talk about ASD as it is to talk about the Big 3. Unfortunately, for the greater part of the past decade, that has not been the case and these misconceptions I have referenced continue to be reinforced by those who may never even know they're doing it.

**WELL THAT WAS A LONG POST**

To wrap things up, a short overview. Autism is a spectrum that covers a ton of behavioral disorders to the point where even someone with mild anxiety disorder can be classified as autistic if they check the right boxes and fuck up on apperception tests. People treat ADHD, depression, and anxiety like clubhouses without being willing to consider they very well may exhibit signs of autism and that is bad because autism (from what I've experienced) is taken much more seriously (or cautiously) than those issues when, for the majority of cases, it isn't (or doesn't need to be). Shit, I've [seen people say](https://sv.s-ul.eu/xnk3jtv3) ""I just thought I was introverted until I realized I'm actually autistic."" I think that shows exactly how casually common this disorder may be, and people need to realize that and treat it as such.

**BONUS YSK** 

""High-functioning autism"" is [not a scientific term](https://www.healthline.com/health/high-functioning-autism#autism-levels) and doesn't mean anything, all it does is force the narrative that every other autistic person is ""low-functioning,"" which is kind of not cool (even if it may technically be true).

I found out a workaround for this:

* Create a new partition on your computers hard disk, and set its size to the amount you want to give to Spotify for downloading songs offline. You might need to shrink existing partition to make space for this.
* Change the Offline song storage location to that new partition in advanced settings.

You can limit the storage usage (cache) by setting wanted partition size.

Disclaimer: this might cause issues if network is spotty. Spotify recommends having at least 1GB of free space for ""*the best listening experience*"", which should be taken into account determinating the wanted partition size. I personally set it to 50 MB, without any apparent issues so far - but listening offline isn't that important for me.

For privacy, I won't use real names. So, my friend John called to inform me the awful night him and his wife, Mary, had recently. He was in the kitchen when he noticed Mary answers her phone kind of late, just before bed, and almost right into the call she's noticeably panicked. Suddenly, she's trying to calm this caller down while John notices she's visibly upset. Mary says something about ""Yes I'm alone, I'm alone!"" She went onto talking about money, and then the call ends. John asks if she's okay. She's shaking, says No and calls the police.

So, what happened was that Mary got a call from someone close to her we'll name Jane. When Mary answered, some guy was trying to calm a sobbing woman down. This guy kept telling Mary she needed to be alone as it was a very private matter. Mary says she's alone, and then the caller demands cash. If cash isn't met, he's going to ""kill her,"" and if Mary calls the police he's then going to kill himself. Mary informs him she doesn't have the amount of cash he was requesting, and the caller hangs up. So Mary calls the cops and they send someone out to the home of Jane. After that, Mary calls someone close to Jane, and briefly informs them what happened and that cops were called, etc. This person calls Jane and Jane answers having no idea what they were talking about. Jane claims they're with someone, so Mary calls that person who assures her Yes they're with Jane. Cops even told my friends they stopped by Jane's home and everything was fine. So, John calls a friend of ours who works for a government agency, and they suggest immediately calling the FBI. Mary calls the FBI, and the FBI take her info and whatnot, but basically told her this is a common scam. They somehow get your phone number and emulate someone else's number. Then they put pressure on you to think someone is kidnapped or hurt, etc. and extort you for cash.

Mary said it started to make sense afterward because the caller never used any names and she never actually heard Jane talk. She just heard a woman sobbing/gasping and since it was Jane's number she just automatically assumed. Who's to say what would have happened had Mary been able to provide the cash.

gw9wro,Master_Maniac,YSK how to treat exposure to chemical agents (specifically tear gas and pepper spray),1591243720.0,,1591244887.0,False,True,False,t3_gw9wro,21,False,172,"The aim of this post is not to be political in any way. However, it is relevant, given recent events, and I wouldn't wish long-term exposure to this stuff on my worst enemy. I am not posting to make a statement on who is right or wrong, only that this is information that everyone should have access to.

&#x200B;

As a former correctional officer, we frequently used similar chemical agents to what the police are currently using against protesters. There are two primary types that are commonly deployed:

First is the tear gas. This comes from a canister, launched from a specialized gun. The tear gas is a dry, micro-pulverized powder, which helps it cling to moisture, allowing it to work for an extended period of time.

The easiest way to get the tear gas off of yourself, for the most part, is simply driving around with your windows down. The wind will blow most of it away, and the residue left over can easily be showered off. Alternatively, if driving isn't possible, find a strong fan. The harder it blows, the more of the powder will come off.

Second is the pepper spray. This is typically delivered at close range via an aerosolized spray can.

In my personal experience, as odd as it may sound, rinsing the affected area with milk seemed to help to remove most of the spray, as well as soothe the burning, due to the milk being cold. Again just make sure to shower afterward, as nobody wants to smell like old milk. (As confirmed by a commentor, u/tallermanchild, the fats in milk help to neutralize capsaicin, which is a primary ingredient for the chemical agents)

In either case, you'll need a shower. Use cold water, as cold as you can stand. Both agents are heat activated, and a hot shower is a good way to feel like you're on fire again.

While showering, take extra care with your hair. That's where a lot of the leftover agents will be stuck. Lean forward in the shower and make sure that the water falls from your head to the ground, and doesn't run down your body. I cannot stress this enough, you do not want any of these chemicals to run into your sensitive areas. If you think taco bell is bad, you'll be in for a rude awakening. (As stated by a u/MassiveCapitalist, use a liberal amount of soap. Water alone isn't going to cut it. u/nmlw99 also mentioned that baby shampoo is great if available, because it's gentler on the affected area, and is a surfactant rather than a detergent.)

Also in both cases, mild chemical burns are possible. It's not going to melt your skin, but much like a sunburn, affected areas can continue to burn for several days, even after washing up. Fortunately, the treatment is also similar. Aloe is what I've found to be most soothing in this case.

For the paintball style rounds, credit to u/InformalConceptsHere for the following information:

>Having 2 layers of clothes would help. Something like a t-shirt and hoodie and then gym shorts and jeans. The extra layers will help soften the hits however the police wont be shooting those rounds at normal paintball speeds (280fps). They will have them set to probably around 350-375fps for the intent of triggering survival instinct of ""oh shit i need to run."" I have personally been shot by paintball guns at around that speed from various distances and it hurts all the same. That being said, it absolutely will hurt no matter what. The layers of clothes will just keep bruises and broken skin to a minimum and you can take the outer layer off once you are safe. If you are protesting you should bring some sort of eye protection and face covering to go over your mask anyways. On the chance it does come down to being shot, your face is the weakest and most vulnerable place to be hit. Anything goes with being shot there, concussions, cuts, busted lips, permanent blindness, ect. Dont risk it and bring protection like prom night with a hot date

&#x200B;

Additionally, whether or not you get gassed, stay hydrated. Use the buddy system, and watch out for anyone near you that's showing possible symptoms of heat exhaustion or stroke.

If you wear contacts and you're planning to protest, leave the contacts at home and wear glasses if possible. These chemicals can melt the materials that make up your contacts, and cause them to fuse to your eyes, potentially leading to permanent damage.

If anyone has additional treatment information for other forms of chemical agents, please post them in a comment and I'll update this post with them.

Stay safe everyone. <3

It seems obvious that not going outside will lead to some health issues, but it's less obvious that this includes Vitamin D deficiency. People experiencing some of these symptoms (myself and a few friends included), should be more aware of this potential issue and vigilant about staying healthy in isolation.

So the moral of the story, make sure you're still going outside, getting daily exercise, and still getting enough Vitamin D in isolation!

(Kind of long, but worth it.)",1591201541.0,,False,False,True,False,t3_gvx2rm,72,False,353,"Lucid dreaming can be useful as a time to work out problems from real life, tackle your fears in a safe environment, and possibly improve tasks in your actual life by practicing them while you're asleep...

But let's face it: We really all just want to fly, or act out our other wildest fantasies with no consequences. And here's how to do it:

Keep a pen and some paper on your nightstand, and any time you wake up from a dream that you can remember, jot down the general themes and obvious details. Once you've done this for a while, you are bound to notice patterns; things you dream about a lot. Find one of these repeating details that you can purposely note while you're awake.

For me, it seems like I'm looking for, or going to the bathroom in a lot of my dreams, and obviously that's something I do often while I'm awake. 

Now, everytime you do that thing while you're awake, really stop and think about whether you're awake or dreaming. It might seem dumb, but if you dream about work a lot, take a minute a couple of times a day while you're working to really try to figure out if you're awake. Pinch yourself or bite the inside of your cheek (gently) to see if you feel it. One great tip: look for something you can read--most people can't read in their dreams; letters tend just be a meaningless jumble, or even move around on the page. Do this kind of test every time you do your dream activity in real life.

Now, most of the time, you'll prove to yourself that you're awake. But... With persistence your brain will train itself this pattern, and soon, you'll find yourself in a dream, doing whatever it is you've identified, examining whether you're actually asleep.  You'll look for something to read and it won't make sense. You'll notice that pinching yourself feels different. You'll realize that you're actually dreaming. Here's where it all pays off--do something. Do anything on purpose. (When I say anything, I mean start with something that isn't dangerous--don't go jumping off a roof to see if you can fly then blame your injuries on me if you were actually awake.) 

Here's the thing: At first, it may be hard to actually stay asleep for long at this point.  Don't be discouraged if you wake up right away. Over time, you'll be able to stay asleep longer, and do more and more.  You'll eventually get more and more control over your dreams. You'll eventually be able to fly; to breathe underwater; to woo that hot guy or girl...

Like anything else this takes practice, but it takes very little effort, has a huge payoff, and it really works if you're very consistent. 

Don't skip steps. Even if you think you know what you dream about all the time, keep jotting stuff down anyway--you'll find more things you didn't think of.  Do the test to see if you're awake constantly--every single time you go to the bathroom (or whatever your dream thing is) look for something with words on it to try reading, etc. This technique does work.

Once you've put it all together, consider coming back here and letting me know how it worked. Or maybe don't--I'm not sure I want to hear about the wildest dreams of anyone here...


TL;DR: While awake, really try to figure out if you're actually awake or dreaming as often as possible. Eventually, you'll start doing this in your dreams and learn to control them once you realize it's a dream. (But seriously, read the whole thing for more info.)",False,0.94,Other

The 911 call center had to evacuate because the building was unsafe and had to be cleared for occupancy before they could return.

On their way out the door, the Captain that ran 911 had an emergency switch that sent all incoming calls to an out of area 911 center.

I don't know where it was sent, but we were in Seattle. So some poor call center in, I think Idaho, all of sudden with no warning, started getting 911 calls from a major metro area having a big earthquake.

First, you should NEVER, EVER place a 911 call after an event like this unless you truly need them. Do NOT call and say: ""Did we just have an earthquake? Wow! How big was it?"" They will hang up on you.

People are going to be in life and death situations, and it may be a much smaller 911 center dealing with it all.

Remember that, if you should need to call for assistance. They may not know what: ""I'm near Westlake, and there's a broken line"" means. You need to be precise. What line? What are the cross streets? Who would be the provider? They won't know it's Puget Power. Answer their questions clearly and patiently because they will be dealing with major stress and call volume with no warning. They want to help you. Help them get the information they need.

Have patience. Everyone will be dealing with the same situation and it's scary.  There are going to be hundreds of calls for help, some critical, some curious. Be sure you really need to call.

1. Is someone trapped? Under what? A tree, a house?  Can you hear them?

2.  Is someone seriously injured? A broken arm is not a 911 call.  Bleeding may or may not be. Just because you are panicking, it is not always a 911 call.    

3. Do not call to ask if your mother is okay, or to ask for a welfare check. Not at this time, immediately after an event. There will not be available personnel to go check on people until later. They understand your concern. It is not an emergency. I remember hearing about a man who ordered  a pizza delivered to his mothers house a few days after a hurricane, since authorities did not have time to do a welfare check. He was worried he hadn't been able to get ahold of her.  He asked the pizza delivery person to verify her identity and if she was okay. That was thinking outside the pizza box! He gave a great tip for it, too!

4. Do not call to ask ""How bad is it? Should I stay home and order a pizza? Do I have to go to work?"" They will hang up on you. You should be ashamed for taking up their time with this. And you would be AMAZED at how many calls are like this. Social media is the best source during events since they are boots on the ground all over your area. Make sure you are connected to community groups BEFORE an event, because no one is going to be going through and approving new people during this time.

5. Do not call because you are having an anxiety attack. Or because you're scared. Thousands will be feeling the same emotions and it's not an emergency. Even if you faint, it is still not an emergency. Leave the lines open for life and death situations.

6. Do not call to say the traffic lights aren't working. Or that the power is out.  Or that you can't watch the game. They know. Nothing can be done right now. Remember the major earthquake during the World Series? Uh huh...how many 911 calls were about ""I CAN'T WATCH THE GAME!""? You'd be shocked. City is on fire, and they are worried about a game.

7. Do not call to ask if it's okay to drive. Use common sense. Wait until you KNOW that the route you need to drive is clear and safe to travel on. Don't become the reason someone else has to call for you to be rescued.  Listen to the news, or online chatter for road conditions and leave those emergency lines open for emergencies.

8. Your cell phone may not work. Cell towers can be affected and with tens of thousands calling at the same time to make sure their loved ones are safe, there is only so much availability. This is the one good reason left for a land line. But land lines may also not work depending on what is going on. If you need emergency responders and have no working phone line, you need to figure out what to do. 

9. Do not call and scream into the phone. No one will be able to send you help if you are screaming in a panic. Yes, you are terrified, something bad is happening. You want help. But they can't help you if you can't tell them what is going on, where you are, and other information. Be calm as possible. They will be quick and brusque with you, because it's an event and they have thousands of other calls.  Get your information out clearly and quickly.

I'm 100% for gay pride. End all discrimination towards LGBTQ! It makes me sick how society has treated homosexual people. But when I log onto Tinder, usually I am pretty horny, and thinking about trying to get laid or even meet a potential romantic partner. Then this rainbow flame pops and I can't help but be reminded of homosexual sex. And you know what? It's actually possible to have both the thought that you dislike discrimination against LGBTQ folks, and the desire not to think about 2 men having sex. Because surprise, surprise, the thought of gay sex for many straight men is unsavoury at the moment we are trying to get laid, as I'm assuming the thought of heterosexual sex is for LGBTQ folks when they are looking for sex. I apologize if I'm wrong about that. In any other context I wouldn't care the slightest and it would make me happy to see it. If you think this post is discriminatory then I apologize, but I think I have it made clear that it's possible to have 2 thoughts in my head at once. I have worked in theatre for about 20 years and encountered about 1,000,000 gay men. Been to gay weddings. Hung out at all gay parties. Have great gay friends. Tinder is shoving it in our face, and the only thing I want shoved in my face is a woman's vagina.

I'm pretty sure this post will be deleted or reported or I will be flamed. Oh well. I tried to express my views while being considerate. I really wish Tinder would give me the option of turning this off, or at least stop it after the first appearance. I think that would be a good balance.

Matched with a woman nearby. Single mom, doesn't have kids every other weekend, she was specifically looking for a FwB situation, as was I. We spent over two weeks talking, seemed really into each other, discussed a detailed plan for getting together later today (her weekend off). Tons of chemistry - she's picking out an outfit, telling me what she's going to wear, what she wants to do to me etc. We have hours of role play construction for how we want the date to go down.

Plan was to meet tonight at a casual fast food place at a specific time, act like we knew each other, get some food, and then go back to her place nearby. Talked to her today and she seemed super excited still. She went to bed early because she had to get up at 6 am to do things today. Kisses me goodnight, can't wait to see me soon, etc. 

I'm a night owl and up late because I have nothing scheduled this morning. I go onto my Tinder account an hour ago... and the chat is gone. Other chats are there, just not her. Tried doing the thing where you create a new account and try to rematch, can't see her profile. 

I know I'm probably the idiot over here who doesn't get he's just been ghosted. Maybe she freaked out. But she had vocalized thoughts on almost everything imaginable over the last couple weeks and we had a super open conversation.

Three questions:

1) What are the odds this is some sort of technical glitch and not a deliberate choice on her part with literally no warning to unmatch me?

2) If she accidentally somehow deleted Tinder, and reinstalls it, would she reappear in my matches? (this seems super unlikely, but making sure I understand how the technical aspect works of the app - not that familiar). 

3) Should I still show up to the restaurant and find out?

Input welcomed. This is super weird.

Edit 1: I've been persuaded by you fine folks to show up later today to see what happens. Will update. In the meanwhile (about 13 hours from this post), I'm very curious to see what people think - did I get ghosted? Or will this be a mutated Sleepless in Seattle situation?

>I am 17

So i had a Tinder account with around 7k pairs that i deleted like a year ago cause i got into a serious relationship. But now since the relationship has ended i thought to myself why not trying the Tinder game again. I created the account which is exactly the same as my previous one. I used Tinder gold on both accounts just to have unlimited swipes and occasionally use the passport thing and superboost if i feel less patient. With my previous account i used to get like 30-50 likes per one superboost and in some countries even around 150. But now with my new account i struggle to get even 1 like with my superboost. Is Tinder screwing me over or whats going on? Has anyone else experienced similar “problems” ?

I've tried different techniques to get more matches, such as changing my profile, using better quality pictures, changing my bio, changing my location, moving up the age setting. 

I've experimented with swiping, first swiping everyone I see then actually been selective with the swipes and reviewing the profiles (I don't know which one is meant to work and which one isn't cause they both didn't by day 3) and now I have no idea what course of action to take other than to pay to play, however I've been told its an awful idea to pay for Tinder.

I wasn't sure what other subreddit to go to...so I hope someone here can help.

I met this guy off tinder in January...hit it off, so much so that I've been staying with him since March. Things are really going well and we both are very open about communication....this is the first time I feel scared to approach him about this. 

This morning, I heard the Tinder notification sound on his phone. Once we got serious, we never discussed deleting the app. I just deleted mine one day assuming I didnt need it any more. 

I know tinder does push notifications to check matches when you havent in a while, and I feel like I used to get them in the morning too. But I swear I haven't heard that sound in 5 months. 

His phone is locked but his sound is ALWAYS on. And his notifications aren't hidden. Hes never shy about texting or using his phone in front of me. And his demeanor, etc has not changed. 

Should I just let this go? And not ask him about it? I really dont know if its worth it or not. Given how many times hes been cheated on and I've been cheated on, I cant see him doing it...especially with me living here....I dont know...:(

EDIT: So I made a burner account and sure enough, he's on there and still swipe-able. I've decided I am not going to take it any further on there and have a conversation with him tonight about it. I've talked to a few friends and the issue really does lay with my confidence. I trust him, but I don't think that I am good enough, and in my mind, that justifies it being okay for him to look around.
